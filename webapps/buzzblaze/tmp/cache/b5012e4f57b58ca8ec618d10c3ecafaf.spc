	<p>One of the first challenges was simply how to take the Basecamp design and make it work on a much smaller screen. It needed to look like Basecamp and be familiar to people who have been using the desktop version for years. We wanted it to perform like a native app but we didn&#8217;t want it to look like one, it was far more important that it looked like Basecamp. This was a big factor in the decision to avoid using one of the existing mobile Javascript UI frameworks.</p>


	<h2>Early inspiration: iOS</h2>


	<p>For the earliest mock-ups it was easy to rely on the excellent UI conventions of the iPhone; most of us are iPhone users at 37signals (as are <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2763-basecamp-mobile-whos-using-it-so-far">many of our customers</a>), we did a lot of testing on the devices, and frankly the UI is very good. It was a great place to start. That meant the first version had an iOS-like navigation bar at the top of the screen with the title of the screen in the center. A button on the left navigated up one level in the hierarchy (backward). A button on the right worked in the context of the current screen. This was pretty much stock from the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/safari/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/TechnologyUsage/TechnologyUsage.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006556-CH18-SW1">iOS Human Interface Guidelines</a>. Here is one of the very first screenshots of Basecamp Mobile:</p>


	<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/37assets/svn/564-first_look.png" alt="First look at Basecamp Mobile" /></p>


	<p>This early mock-up was just static <span class="caps">HTML</span>. We used the iPhone <span class="caps">SDK</span> simulator even at this stage to make it seem as real as possible.</p>


	<h2>Finding our own way</h2>


	<p>We continued with this design for some time but a few problems kept coming up. We&#8217;d used the item type instead of it&#8217;s title in the navigation bar because titles can be very long. So now we had two bars that both titled the screen, but in different ways. And even using all that space it still wasn&#8217;t clear where you were. <em>Where does the back button go?</em> <em>Which project is this list in?</em></p>


	<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/37assets/svn/566-old_nav.png" alt="Header variations" /></p>


	<p>After a few more iterations we knew something wasn&#8217;t right. We were trying too hard to squeeze our app into a navigation idea that wasn&#8217;t the right fit.</p>


	<h2>Starting over</h2>


	<p>Right about this time I happened to be in Chicago so I sat down with Ryan and Jason Fried to brainstorm some new ideas. We were sure that the iOS style navigation bar wasn&#8217;t going to work. We had to be able to show a lot more information than it was capable of&mdash;especially since titles were often much longer than the available space offered (usually just a word or two). Here are the pieces that needed to be included:</p>


	<ol>
	<li>Back button</li>
		<li>Title of the screen or item</li>
		<li>Name of the project</li>
		<li>Context actions (Add and Edit)</li>
		<li>Account theme (header color)</li>
	</ol>


	<p>I went immediately to work quickly sketching a single header with more dense information.</p>

<blockquote>

	<p>I grew up reading catalogs. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/07/books/review/Collins-t.html">The Herter&#8217;s catalogue</a>* was the most opinionated one out there, but it was also the most entertaining. Sometimes I&#8217;ll read an online comment that, &#8220;Rivendell (or Grant) is so opinionated&#8221; and it&#8217;s supposed to be a criticism. It&#8217;s not a criticism. If you want to criticize me, there are way better ways to do it. Tell me I don&#8217;t have my facts right, or I don&#8217;t give credit where it is due, or my grammar is bad, or my jokes are stupid. That will do the job of hurting my feelings, but being accused of being opinionated is a compliment.</p>


	<p>The best catalogues ever were the 1972 and 1973 Chouinard Equipment/Great Pacific Iron Works climbing catalogs. There will never be catalogues like those again. Everybody who writes copy or catalogs or online stuff or reads at all should read those.</p>

Turns out <a href="http://climbaz.com/chouinard72/chouinard.html">the 1972 Chouinard Catalog</a> is online. Copies of the original catalog <a href="http://www.climbingaction.com/The-Whole-Natural-Art-of-Protection.html">fetch $200+ on eBay</a>. But to understand its impact, you first need to know the context around it.</p>


	<p><strong>The Chouinard backstory</strong> <br />
The backstory to the company is a &#8220;scratch your own itch&#8221; tale. It starts with pitons, the metal spikes climbers drive into cracks. They used to be made of soft iron. Climbers placed them once and left them in the rock.</p>


	<p>But in 1957, a young climber named Yvon Chouinard <a href="http://www.patagonia.com/uspro/patagonia.go?assetid=3351">decided to make his own reusable hardware</a>. He went to a junkyard and bought a used coal-fired forge, a 138-pound anvil, some tongs and hammers, and started teaching himself how to blacksmith. He made his first chrome-molybdenum steel pitons and word spread. Soon, he was in business and selling them for $1.50 each to other climbers. By 1970, Chouinard Equipment had become the largest supplier of climbing hardware in the U.S.</p>


	<p>But there was a problem. The company&#8217;s gear was damaging the rock. The same routes were being used over and over and the same fragile cracks had to endure repeated hammering of pitons. The disfiguring was severe. So Chouinard and his  business partner Tom Frost decided to phase out of the piton business, despite the fact that it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yvon_Chouinard">comprised 70% of the company&#8217;s business</a>. Chouinard introduced an alternative: aluminum chocks that could be wedged by hand rather than hammered in and out of cracks. They were introduced in that 1972 catalog, the company&#8217;s first. The bold move worked. Within a few months, the piton business atrophied and chocks sold faster than they could be made.</p>


	<p><strong>Looking at the catalog</strong> <br />
So what kind of catalog do you put out when you&#8217;re reversing your entire business? Chouinard went with a mix of product descriptions, climbing advice, inspirational quotes, and essays that served as a &#8220;clean climbing&#8221; manifesto. It opens with a statement on the deterioration of both the physical aspect of the mountains and the moral integrity of climbers.</p>


<blockquote>

	<p>No longer can we assume the earth&#8217;s resources are limitless; that there are ranges of unclimbed peaks extending endlessly beyond the horizon. Mountains are finite, and despite their massive appearance, they are fragile&#8230;</p>


	<p>We believe the only way to ensure the climbing experience for ourselves and future generations is to preserve (1) the vertical wilderness, and (2) the adventure inherent in the experience. Really, the only insurance to guarantee this adventure and the safest insurance to maintain it is exercise of moral restraint and individual responsibility.</p>


	<p>Thus, it is the style of the climb, not attainment of the summit, which is the measure of personal success. Traditionally stated, each of us must consider whether the end is more important than the means. Given the vital importance of style we suggest that the keynote is simplicity. The fewer gadgets between the climber and the climb, the greater is the chance to attain the desired communication with oneself&#8212;and nature.</p>


	<p>The equipment offered in this catalog attempts to support this ethic.</p>

<em>A guide for clean climbers.</em></p>


	<p>A few pages later, there is <a href="http://www.climbingaction.com/The-Whole-Natural-Art-of-Protection_02.html">a guide for clean climbers</a>.</p>


<blockquote>

	<p>There is a word for it, and the word is clean. Climbing with only nuts and runners for protection is clean climbing. Clean because the rock is left unaltered by the passing climber. Clean because nothing is hammered into the rock and then hammered back out, leaving the rock scarred and next climber&#8217;s experience less natural. Clean is climbing the rock without changing it; a step closer to organic climbing for the natural man.</p>

It&#8217;s especially true when designing applications for current mobile devices. Tapping a touch screen is less precise than clicking with a mouse. Touch screens also lack the tactile and auditory feedback of a physical key or button. Slow, unreliable cellular data access adds to the confusion. A user might wonder: Is the app broken or do I have a poor connection? Was my tap registered or did my fingers miss that tiny button? Making sure users get clear feedback in response to their actions and to changes in state or conditions is key to a great software experience.</p>


	<p>When we designed <a href="http://basecamphq.com/mobile">Basecamp Mobile</a> we decided to use a variety of methods to keep people informed about the current state of the app. Different conditions can require different feedback, so we had to carefully consider multiple types of feedback. Here are some examples:</p>


	<h2>Touch</h2>


	<p>It was important for us to make taps in the app feel responsive. Even if there could be a delay before the associated action executed it was essential that the user knew the tap was successful. Anything that can be tapped in Basecamp Mobile has a selected state that highlights the item immediately when the user touches the screen. Here you can see how a selected item on the project screen:</p>

The app runs entirely in the browser, rendering <span class="caps">HTML</span> with Javascript and loading only your account content from the server when needed. Each screen has a number of states depending on the status of the screen&#8217;s content. A single loading indicator wouldn&#8217;t cut it—the feedback had to be appropriate to each situation. Here are some of the states we had to consider in the design:</p>


	<h3>Initial load</h3>


	<p>Basecamp Mobile is loading assets the first time you run it or when the local cache is empty. The large animation is the only element on the screen making it the focus. The lack of any other UI elements makes it clear that the only option here is to wait. Because people see this before they see the app, it&#8217;s even more important that we let them know what is happening.</p>


	<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/37assets/svn/557-post_app_loading.png" alt="App loading state" /></p>


	<p>If this initial load is taking too long we let the user know. After a short wait, the app reassures people that it&#8217;s still working.</p>


	<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/37assets/svn/558-post_app_slow.png" alt="Slow loading state" /></p>


	<p>If the screen still doesn&#8217;t load after a few more seconds the app offers some other options: Refresh the browser and try again or try the standard version. The latter option is useful for users who may be attempting to load the mobile optimized version on an unsupported device and need the option to switch back to the normal version.</p>


	<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/37assets/svn/559-post_app_veryslow.png" alt="Very slow loading" /></p>


	<h3>Loading content</h3>


	<p>In the next state, the app has loaded and the UI is now available, the app is only loading content now. The user can always cancel the action and go back to the previous screen. You&#8217;ll see this the first time you load a screen that you haven&#8217;t loaded before like a newly posted message.</p>


	<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/37assets/svn/560-post_content_load.png" alt="Cold cache loading" /></p>


	<h3>Refreshing content</h3>


	<p>Basecamp Mobile caches screens as you visit them so going back and forth between them is nearly instant. Because the data could be old we need to check the server for changes, new items, new comments, etc. The screen might be perfectly fine, or it might need to load in changes. While this is happening we show a small, less prominent indicator. The page is fully functional but we want to let the user know that we&#8217;re talking to the server. This indicator isn&#8217;t in the user&#8217;s face or in the way of what they&#8217;re doing. It&#8217;s just a notice that the app is working and if you&#8217;re expecting something new, we&#8217;re checking. You can see the spinning icon in the upper-right of this screenshot:</p>


	<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/37assets/svn/561-post_syncing.png" alt="Syncing indicator" /></p>


	<p>The icon actually duplicates the functionality of the browser&#8217;s own loading spinner (visible in the top toolbar in the screenshot above) but we felt like people were likely to ignore or completely miss it. The approach brings the loading indicator a little closer to the action without making it more intrusive.</p>


	<h3>Loading previews</h3>


	<p>We took a similar approach with the To-do Lists screen. For each list we wanted to show the first few items on it. This makes it clear these are to-do lists and helps people identify the one they need. The previews load after the page is available because the content is helpful but not essential. A very subtle effect doesn&#8217;t distract but makes it clear something is happening. A series of spinners would have overwhelmed this screen, but the subtle gradient shine moving over the word &#8220;loading&#8221; informs without distracting.</p>


	<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/37assets/svn/562-post_todo_list.png" alt="List preview loading" /></p>


	<h2>Final thoughts</h2>


	<p>Presented like this it may appear that the app is just a series of waits, it&#8217;s not. Most of these indicators are actually on the screen for just seconds, but that is sufficient time to quiet a user&#8217;s doubts and ensure they know things are working. It feels great to click through the app and always feel like you know what&#8217;s happening, that things are working.</p>


	<p>We use prominence of these indicators to tell people how important it is that they wait. The amount of surrounding UI is a clue about what else they can do if they don&#8217;t want to. You certainly have to wait for the app, itself, to load. But you can pass right by a To-do list that&#8217;s fetching a preview of it&#8217;s items. Just the right UI feedback makes sure users know this without having to think about it.</p><div class="feedflare">

	<p>Smiley has had a tremendous positive impact on our overall customer service. We&#8217;ve learned a lot about what it takes to make a customer happy. And our customers are happier as a result. As it goes, if you want to improve something, measure it.</p>


	<p>Inside 37signals, everyone can see our customer service ratings. We have a dashboard that shows how we&#8217;re doing. It&#8217;s great. I look at the page a dozen times a day to see how we&#8217;re doing. When I pitch in on support I&#8217;m very conscious of my ratings. Knowing how you&#8217;re doing helps you do better.</p>


<h2>Going public</h2>

	<p>However, we want to go even further. We want to be held to even higher standards of excellence when it comes to our customer service.

Recently, we talked with Rivendell owner Grant Petersen to find out more about his business. (Grant also answers some reader questions in the comments.)</em></p>


	<p><strong>What custom means</strong> <br />
When Grant Petersen was 19, he ordered a custom bamboo fly rod made by Doug Merrick of <a href="http://web.winstonrods.com/">the Winston Rod Company</a>. &#8220;I wanted red winding on the guides &mdash; &#8216;Like a <a href="http://www.hlleonard.com/">Leonard</a> rod,&#8217; I said &mdash;  and a cork grip shaped like a <a href="http://www.efpaynerodcompany.com/">Payne</a> rod. They were two other fancy rods,&#8221; explains Peterson. Merrick refused. &#8220;I won&#8217;t do it,&#8221; he told Petersen. &#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t be my rod, then.&#8221;</p>


	<p>Petersen says, &#8220;I felt ashamed for having asked, but glad to have been told that. And it made me appreciate the details that made a Winston a Winston.&#8221; Decades later, Petersen points to that interaction as inspiration for how he deals with customers at <a href="http://www.rivbike.com/">Rivendell</a>, his biking business. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want anybody to feel ashamed for asking us to drill holes in forks or make a bike with low &#8216;trail,&#8217; but I&#8217;m resolved not to do it for the same reason Doug Merrick held his ground.</p>


	<p>&#8220;To a customer, a custom frame can mean &#8216;I pay you money and you let me design the bike,&#8217; but that&#8217;s not what custom means here. We&#8217;ve turned down &#8216;custom&#8217; orders when it&#8217;s meant all we do is collect the money and facilitate the customer&#8217;s own design. It can be seen as not customer-friendly, but in the end it means I know that every custom has the qualities I value and a certain amount of integrity. If you stand for something and are committed to it, then you dilute it if you introduce something that&#8217;s less pure or hard-core.&#8221;</p>


<blockquote class="pullquote">If you stand for something and are committed to it, then you dilute it if you introduce something that&#8217;s less pure or hard-core.</blockquote>

	<p><strong>Opinions are mandatory</strong> <br />
Rivendell sells the kinds of bikes and bike gear you can&#8217;t get in a normal bike shop. According to Petersen, &#8220;99 percent of the bike market &mdash; designers, buiders, distributers, retailers, buyers, and riders &mdash; are selling the wrong bikes to the wrong people for the wrong reasons.&#8221;</p>


	<p><a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2589-on-writing-selling-gear-and-teaching-about-bikes-at-rivendell">Strong opinions</a> are at the heart of Rivendell&#8217;s mission. &#8220;Specs are fine, but they take two seconds, and opinions, if they&#8217;re based on experience, are more interesting. If you know about something, you have an opinion about it.</p>


	<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s always a story behind the pure specs of something. Does it mean anything to anybody that a Nitto handlebar may be made from 2014 T6 aluminum? If you leave it at that, it doesn&#8217;t. It not only doesn&#8217;t, it&#8217;s a bad thing to just say that, because it&#8217;s really saying, &#8216;I read that this is true. It sounds important. I don&#8217;t know what it means. But I hope you think that I do.&#8217; But I can add that Nitto handlebars are the strongest and safest and most rigidly tested in the world and if Nitto says it can&#8217;t make a strong enough bar that weighs less than 265g, then you can believe nobody else can.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<em>Grant Petersen (photo by <a href="20070724_rivendell_a_0001.jpg">Martin Sundberg</a>)</em></p>


	<p>The opinionated path is one that has long appealed to Petersen. &#8220;In the &#8216;70s and early &#8216;80s, I worked at <a href="http://www.rei.com/"><span class="caps">REI</span></a> in Berkeley and there was a rule: No Handwritten Signs. We had a sign-making machine, and the store wanted a consistent look in all the signs. There&#8217;d be a sign for &#8216;Camping Books&#8217;. It was yellow-brown with dark brown letters and that&#8217;s all it said. But there was one book with the unfortunate title of <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=AqgXAQAAMAAJ&#38;q=Pleasure+Packing+book&#38;dq=Pleasure+Packing+book&#38;hl=en&#38;ei=fkBTTcanH4Sq8AaJv52YCg&#38;sa=X&#38;oi=book_result&#38;ct=book-thumbnail&#38;resnum=1&#38;ved=0CEAQ6wEwAA">&#8216;Pleasure Packing&#8217;</a> that seemed super soft-core by its title and cover, but was actually really radical inside with stuff I didn&#8217;t even know. And I thought I knew everything.</p>


	<p>&#8220;I looked up sales on that book. Berkeley sold about 10 a year; Seattle (the only other <span class="caps">REI</span> at the time) sold about 20. I wrote a note about the book on a piece of cardboard, put clear packing tape over it so it wouldn&#8217;t smear, installed a grommet in the corner of it, and hung it in the book section. The first year after that we sold 215 of them. To me, it wasn&#8217;t about the sales. It was about getting the information out there.</p>

This was on a Tuesday, and the mobile app was scheduled (at the time) to launch on Friday.</p>


	<p>We have a Canon 5d Mark II at the office for general photo and video. Steve Delahoyde (video genius) at <a href="http://coudal.com">Coudal Partners</a> graciously lent us his lights and light tent for the shoot. Here&#8217;s what the rig looked like (set up in our kitchen).</p>


	<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/37assets/svn/555-video-rig.jpg" width="530" height="600" /></p>


	<p><strong>The direction</strong></p>


	<p>I wanted the video to be more about Bascamp Mobile supporting many devices rather than showing off the interface. The video had to be short and it had to tell what I thought was the most important story: You can use Basecamp on your iPhone, Android, Blackberry Torch, and Palm Pre 2.</p>


	<p><strong>First take</strong></p>


	<p>An initial idea we had was to show a hand passing a different phone across the screen: iPhone, Blackberry, Nexus One, etc. The idea that Basecamp could run on all these devices took too long to get across.</p>

	<p><strong>Out of focus</strong></p>


	<p>The better idea was to focus on the iPhone &mdash; make it seem like this is a Basecamp for iPhone spot. Then at the end we would show that Basecamp was also available on these other devices. Jason Fried had the idea to show different hands showing all of the phones.</p>


	<p>The only problem was that the other phones were out of focus. No matter we had the idea down, we just needed to reshoot it.</p>

<blockquote>I decided to do one on some of the tools I use most in my day-to-day
interactions with the rest of GitHub: <a href="http://campfirenow.com/?source=svn_post">Campfire</a>, my
<a href="https://github.com/holman/dotfiles">dotfiles</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/holman/boom">boom</a>. By combining all of these together, we
can successfully make your company&rsquo;s chat room super inefficient. Apply some
programming and boom, you&rsquo;re suddenly <strong>automating inefficiencies</strong>.</blockquote>

I&#8217;m our &#8220;business analyst&#8221;, &#8220;data guy&#8221; or &#8220;stats guy&#8221;, but those all leave some explanation lacking of who I am and what I do.</p>


<h2>Who are you?</h2>

	<p>I&#8217;m a mechanical engineer by training, but I spent the last couple of years working at McKinsey &#38; Company, a consulting firm. I did a range of different things, but spent most of my time focusing on understanding and predicting individuals&#8217; behavior as it relates to the healthcare system &#8211; how people use physicians, hospitals, and their health insurance policy. I live and work just outside of Pittsburgh, PA.</p>


<h2>What would you say you do here?</h2>

	<p>I tend to think that there are three things that I&#8217;m trying to do.</p>


<ol><li>Look at data to try to improve our products- understanding how people interact with and use our products helps us make better decisions about how to improve them. Sometimes this is about new features; other times, it&#8217;s about the smaller details &#8211; where does a pagination break make sense based on how many projects people have?

	<p><br>We&#8217;re planning to share some specific examples of how we&#8217;re using data to inform design decisions over the next few months.</li></p>


<li>Use data to help grow &#8211; Too much of using data to &#8220;help businesses grow&#8221; is about predicting (guessing) revenue or profit in five years. This is kind of fun intellectually (and there are cleverly named tools like <a href = http://www.oracle.com/us/products/middleware/bus-int/crystalball/index.html>&#8220;Crystal Ball&#8221;</a> to do this), but it&#8217;s less useful than finding real things that we can do today or in the near future that will meaningfully impact the business. This means focusing on why people cancel, how they interact with signup pages, etc.</li>
<br>
<li>Answer those &#8220;I wonder&#8221; questions- one of my favorite parts of working at 37signals is watching products develop every day in Campfire and on Basecamp. While doing that, people occasionally start a sentence with &#8220;I wonder&#8230;&#8221;. I get to move from wondering to knowing, and that&#8217;s loads of fun to do.</li>
</ol>
<h2>How do you do what you do?</h2>

	<p>There&#8217;s nothing magical here &#8211; most of the challenge is just about knowing the right questions to ask and understanding the relationships between data. The actual tools matter a lot less.</p>


	<p>We have a few reporting tools that we&#8217;ve built, and use a few commercial tools (<a href=http://www.google.com/analytics/>Google Analytics</a>, <a href=http://www.getclicky.com>Clicky</a>), but most analysis gets done from raw data.  I do virtually all of my work within a statistical programming language called <a href=http://cran.r-project.org>R</a> (with a couple of custom functions to interface to our databases and APIs for Clicky, etc.) and with simple unix tools like awk/sed. This combination is incredibly simple, powerful, and adaptable, and R has a great community behind it. I use a couple of different tools to produce graphics (mostly <a href=http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/>ggplot2</a> in R and <a href=http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnigraphsketcher/>OmniGraphSketcher</a>), and I&#8217;m experimenting with narrated screencasts, etc. to share results as well. Of course, <a href=http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2760-rpn-ever-4->my trusty HP-12C never leaves my desk.</a></p>

	<p>It&#8217;s a beautifully simple and clear departure from the overtly complicated designs that you&#8217;ll often find when you browse design firms, architecture firms, and, most notably, photographers&#8217; sites.</p>


	<p>The new <span class="caps">CSA</span> site confidently says: <em>We know what we&#8217;re doing</em>. When you&#8217;re this good you don&#8217;t have to show off.</p>


	<p>No hovers, no lightboxes, no scrolling images, no flash, no unnecessary clicks, nothing fancy at all. It&#8217;s presented clearly, directly, and without stuffy ceremony. The latest fad, technique, or technology is nowhere to be found. They&#8217;re comfortable in their own skin and it shows.</p>


	<p>It&#8217;s effortless. I just love it.</p>


	<p>Click on a project and you get <a href="http://www.csadesign.com/ev_fpc_poptone_posters.html">a straightforward page</a> with the work down the middle and the details in the margin. Each project has its own <span class="caps">URL</span> and is easily sharable and printable. <span class="caps">CSA</span>&#8217;s address and phone number is on every page. Just plain smart.</p>


	<p>The copywriting is clear and it has purpose. It&#8217;s not too serious, too clever, or too cute. It&#8217;s plain english, yet colorful where it matters. It wants to be read. This kind of writing respects the reader.</p>


	<p>Whenever someone asks me for an example of a site designed by someone who understands the fundamental strengths of the web, I will point to <a href="http://www.csadesign.com"><span class="caps">CSA</span>&#8217;s site</a>. This is <em>the</em> example.</p>

	<p>Basecamp Mobile is not an native app, it&#8217;s a web app. All you have to do is visit <a href="http://basecamphq.com/?source=svn_post">http://basecamphq.com</a> on your mobile phone. No apps and nothing to install &#8211; it just works.</p>


	<p>A mobile version of Basecamp has been a top customer request for some time now. We&#8217;re thrilled to finally be able to deliver. We put a ton of work into it. We hope you love it as much as we do.</p>


<h2>Why a web app and not a native app?</h2>

	<p>Back in July we put up <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2485-were-hiring-an-iosmobile-developer">a job ad for an iOS developer</a>. We had decided to dive into native apps for the iPhone. We contracted out the back-end development of our <a href="http://highrisehq.com/iphone">iPhone app for Highrise</a>. The project went well, but we felt like we had to have someone in-house to continue the development of the Highrise app and future apps we wanted to build.</p>


	<p>And then Android really began to make a run. Android market share increased and more and more customers were asking for Android apps for our web apps. So we stopped and thought about it for a bit. Do we want to have to hire an iOS developer and an Android developer? That&#8217;s a lot of specialization, and we&#8217;re usually anti-specialization when it comes to development.</p>


	<p>Eventually we came to the conclusion that we should stick with what we&#8217;re good at: web apps. We know the technologies well, we have a great development environment and workflow, we can control the release cycle, and everyone at 37signals can do the work. It&#8217;s what we already do, just on a smaller screen. We all loved our smaller screens so we were eager to dive in. Plus, since WebKit-based browsers were making their way to the webOS and Blackberry platforms too, our single web-app would eventually run on just about every popular smartphone platform.</p>


	<p>Comfortable and confident in our decision, we set out to build the best possible mobile web app for our Basecamp customers.</p>


<h2>This is version 1.0</h2>

	<p>A big part of this initial release was nailing the basics that mattered the most. We had to make a bunch of hard calls about what was important enough to make version 1. That meant leaving some things out and not bringing full functionality to other things. For example, you can view Milestones but you can&#8217;t add new ones. But you can view, add, change, and assign to-dos. We plan on rounding out the functionality as time goes on.</p>


<h2>More to share soon</h2>

	<p>We have a lot of material and lessons to share regarding the design and development of Basecamp Mobile. Technical decisions, design decisions, explorations, stuff on the cutting room floor. Lots to share. Stay tuned.</p>


<h2>Credit</h2>

	<p>Basecamp Mobile is here today because of the hard work and extraordinary creativity of Jason Zimdars, Sam Stephenson, and Josh Peek.  These guys worked their asses off on this project. They made it happen. We couldn&#8217;t be happier with the results.</p>


<h2>Thanks to our customers</h2>

	<p>To all our customers: Thanks for being patient while we developed <a href="http://basecamphq.com/mobile">Basecamp Mobile</a>. It took a while, but we wanted to get it right. We now have a completely modern, fantastic foundation upon which we can continue to make the mobile experience better and better. Plus, we&#8217;ll be able to reuse some of the new technology in the desktop versions of our web apps. We&#8217;re already working on something big right now that&#8217;s only possible because of our work on mobile.</p>

It’s like taking the cake out without letting it be in the oven for more than a minute. Like, oh no, it’s terrible.

Two neat items there:</p>


	<p>Master Lock&#8217;s Speed Dial combination lock reinvents an object that&#8217;s remained static for decades. It opens on up/down/left/right directional movements which are more intuitive than numbers or alpha-numeric code and easier for folks who are elderly or have disabilities.</p>


	<p>In <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/1662397/reinventing-the-combination-lock">&#8220;How Do You Reinvent Something as Common as the Padlock?&#8221;</a>, Lea Plato, lead designer of the lock, explains the design process.</p>


<blockquote>

	<p>Electronics in general hint a lot at directional movement. We use that kind of movement all the time in all different things, whether it’s volume control or play and fast forward. Even way back, the <span class="caps">VCR</span> used directional symbols to show what you wanted to do. I think being around technology everywhere—and it hinting at directional movement—played a part in the actual function of the lock. You just remember directional movement more easily. It’s more intuitive than numbers or alpha-numeric code.</p>

	<p><a href="http://www.johnsphones.com/">John’s Phone</a> is a great example of <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch02_Build_Less.php">underdoing</a> the competition. It’s a cell phone that makes and accepts calls. That’s it. The phone even includes a store-it-inside-the-phone paper pad and pen for jotting down numbers.</p>

Plus, it seems great for toddlers in a &#8220;My First Phone&#8221; kinda way. <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/1662784/wanted-the-world-s-simplest-cell-phone">More details at Fast Company.</a><br clear="all" /></p><div class="feedflare">

<p>Props to Jason, Ann, and Michael for delivering some serious happiness to our customers on support this week. Usually it&#8217;s pretty tough to get the last 50 responses above a 90-rating on even a good day and right now everyone is doing it. Only 4 frowns out of the last 250 comments (or ~1700 interactions as only ~15% of people contacting support will rate the interaction).</p><div class="feedflare">

<p>Jason&#8217;s latest Inc. Magazine column: &#8220;People don&#8217;t judge you on the basis of your mistakes &mdash; they judge you on the manner in which you own up to them. In my experience, most companies do a terrible job of taking blame. They lob press releases. Or they apologize for the inconvenience. Resist that temptation and say you&#8217;re sorry like you&#8217;re apologizing to a friend.
