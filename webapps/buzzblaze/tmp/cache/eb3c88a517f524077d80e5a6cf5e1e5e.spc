Theoretically it may provide some ROI, but it&#8217;ll likely be short-lived, and either way it wouldn&#8217;t be safe to build a whole strategy around the tactic.</p>
<p>Conversely, manual link building is a time-consuming process involving planning, research, content creation, outreach, and more. With a successful campaign the ROI can be tremendous despite all that time invested. Fortunately, we have some tools that provide assistance in this otherwise difficult task from SEOmoz, SEO Book, Raven, MajesticSEO and others.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;ve found there are still some small holes in the link builders&#8217; toolkit, whether that be in research, monitoring, outreach, etc. The following are some of the processes that I would love to have automated by a tool, but are either  too difficult to build on my own or are really just impossible. Nevertheless, I hope I can spark some conversation at the very least. Without further adieu:</p>
<h2>Instant Alert for Citation&nbsp;Mentions</h2>
<p>Will Critchlow of Distilled built a rough draft of this very tool <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/futuristic-ways-of-creating-automated-link-building-tools">in his post on SEOmoz</a>. The tool monitors the web via Google Alerts, and at the first sign of an unlinked mention of a company, the tool alerts the SEO, providing a quick target for outreach.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.searchenginejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/mention-monitor-example.png" alt="" /></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Hi there, I&#8217;m writing from Company X. We&#8217;re doing a bit of outreach to build company awareness, and I stumbled upon your blog post/article that mentions us. I was wondering if you&#8217;d consider linking to us where you&#8217;ve mentioned my company&#8230;&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Ideally, the tool works fast, as the author is much more likely to make a quick edit for a recent post. As an added bonus, this tool would provide the Twitter handle or email address of the post&#8217;s author, as described in a later &#8216;dream&#8217; tool.</p>
<h2>Competitor Link Monitoring 404&nbsp;Follower</h2>
<p>A brilliant link building tactic that has been <a href="http://ontolo.com/blog/easy-link-building-your-competitors-404-errors">discussed</a> in the <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/a-linkbuilding-method-so-effective-i-cant-believe-its-not-blackhat">past</a> is doing competitive research to determine where links to your competitions&#8217; domains send a 404. Again, this provides an awesome outreach target:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Hi. I noticed your link to Company X&#8217;s website is no longer working. I thought you might find this page a suitable replacement: URL&#8230;&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.searchenginejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/competitor-404-monitor.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>A tool to continuously monitor your competitors&#8217; backlinks and alert you in the event of a 404 would be fantastic. Once again, bonus points if the tool could provide contact information to the linking site with the alert.</p>
<h2>Successful Linkbait Campaign&nbsp;Finder</h2>
<p>Working at a web marketing agency I&#8217;m faced with the task of getting a grasp on a niche relatively quick. New clients would love to hit the ground running with link building campaigns, and I can&#8217;t blame them. But their niche could very well be uncharted territory for me or anyone in the office. It&#8217;d be foolish to say I knew what the influencers in this niche love to share without doing some research.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where this tool that locates the past successful linkbait campaigns in the niche would be invaluable. Hypothetically, the SEO could provide this tool with a seed list of domains in the niche, the tool would expand to include more within this broad &#8216;neighborhood&#8217;, and would return the linkbait most often shared.</p>
<p>An alternative approach would be a search mashup that when queried with a niche would return the blog posts, videos, infographics, and other embeds that have received the most links and shares. In other words, a modern search engine without on-page or domain level off-page signals. A bit more difficult, but I&#8217;d imagine popular bookmarking services like Delicious could provide context for URLs and domains with collective users&#8217; tags.</p>
<h2>Guest Post Opportunity&nbsp;Finder</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s a tool idea that is really just a mashup of a related sites or &#8216;neighborhood&#8217; finder tool and a set of advanced search queries.</p>
<p>Provide a niche, or a seed set of related domains, and this tool returns related domains that have allowed guest posts in the past (using a simple &#8220;guest post&#8221; OR &#8220;guest author&#8221; OR, etc. query). Bonus points, yet again, for contact details of target blogs.</p>
<h2>Widget/Embed&nbsp;Finder</h2>
<p>Ever since the demise of the effectiveness of Yahoo&#8217;s Site Explorer, I&#8217;ve bemoaned the inability to query a set of backlinks&#8217; on-page content. I most often did this to get a feel for a company or their competitors&#8217; link building successes with widget or other embeddable content. Oh, &#8220;linkdomain:domain.com &#8216;embed footprint&#8217;&#8221; query, how I miss thee.</p>
<p>My coworker Justin Briggs blogged about an alternative, which involved creating a <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/replace-yahoo-linkdomain-with-google-custom-search-engine">Google custom search engine</a>. This approach is brilliant, but is time-consuming and has some limitations.</p>
<p>My hypothetical tool wouldn&#8217;t have to be too different from the functionality that Site Explorer used to have. Provide the tool with a domain, which returns links to that domain, then allows the SEO to query the page content of those linking URLs.</p>
<p>An enhancement would be a tool that detects similar text surrounding a set of backlinks, so the SEOs query could be just a domain or URL, and the tool returns backlinks that may be from embeddable content.</p>
<h2>A True Social Shares / Link Building&nbsp;Mashup</h2>
<p>With an ever-growing importance on social signals, I think its time to start including this data in our backlink reports. Of course, easier said than done. But a tool that returns a top pages report for a domain, a la Open Site Explorer, combined with the number of tweets, FB shares, upvotes, Stumbles, etc., would be fantastic.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.searchenginejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/social-link-mashup.png" alt="" /></p>
<h2>Contact Details&nbsp;Retriever</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve referenced this hypothetical tool more than once with good reason; it&#8217;s a time consuming and arduous task. I&#8217;ve also included it last on my list because not only would it be incredibly useful, but it&#8217;s probably impossible to build to return reliable results (and maybe illegal?). Shame.</p>
<p>But, in theory, we&#8217;d provide this tool with a set of outreach target URLs or domains, and it would return Twitter handles and email addresses on the page. Technically, not an impossible task, but how would we know we&#8217;re receiving THE contact details?</p>
<h2>In&nbsp;Conclusion</h2>
<p>Automated link building isn&#8217;t the greatest way to build links, but automating pieces of link building with some of the above hypothetical tools would decrease the necessary investment, and allow SEOs to focus more on being creative and providing greater return.</p>

The search engines have grown by leaps and  bounds over the last decade and they will most likely grow by leaps and bounds  over the next ten years as well.</p>
<p>As long as innovation is on the forefront and  designers and developers continue to push the envelope of their skill sets we  as marketers will have to maintain a certain level of enthusiasm towards  adapting to these new technological changes in order to grow through search  engine optimization.<br />
<strong>Let’s  go over some reasons, I feel the SEO industry continues to change:</strong></p>
<h2>Search  Engine Spammers Take Some&nbsp;Blame</h2>
<p>One  thing that is important to understand is that often times a technology change  opens some sort of window for spammers to pounce on. Almost like a boxing match  the search engines have to fight back with a counter punch in order to stun the  spammers and get them to pull back a bit. This sort of cat and mouse game is partially  why the SERP’s are always shifting gears also. If they did not shift gears  causing the good apples to have to adjust their marketing strategies the search  engines would be inundated with even more spam than they already are. Spammers  over time learn the technology loop holes and try their hardest to capitalize  on the windows of opportunity usually causing everyone else unneeded grief.</p>
<p>The  search engines have no choice but to have to make necessary changes or they run  the risk of losing potential users overtime. The trickle-down effect comes to  us having to make changes on how we approach the search space, although the  good white hat and proven approaches never go out of style.</p>
<h2>Social  Media had Changed the SEO&nbsp;Industry</h2>
<p>Don’t  get me wrong social media is an amazing communication breakthrough and the  social ability has opened the doors for smaller business to really be able to  compete with the big dogs in any industry. But search engines have been forced  to adapt to social media and it is something they are still working on. It’s  still anybody’s game from a SERP standpoint on how social media will be  displayed and embraced. The search engines have made their attempts on how to  provide data directly in the search results but I think we are still on the  nose end of things.</p>
<p>As the search engines identify better opportunities on how  to properly incorporate social media aspects into the search engine marketing  game it is going to cause us marketers to have to shift gears once again.  Personally I enjoy the dynamic landscape that morphs and molds on a weekly  basis because it creates an environment that is filled with excitement. It is  nice to have a new vehicle of communication or branding but with that comes  change and a great deal of it you as a business has to be willing to roll with  the punches.</p>
<h2>Search Technology and New Constant&nbsp;Innovation</h2>
<p>There has been a boom on the technology and innovation side of the  spectrum. Developers are getting smart and quicker with the web applications  they produce leaving businesses and marketers needing to scramble around with  education. If a new web application or tool makes its way into the business  limelight it is up to you as a business to be able to learn how to leverage  that platform to build awareness to your company or brand. With this innovation  comes a change in how you market your business through the search engines and  that is something that is not going to slow down anytime soon.</p>
<p>Search engine  marketing movers and shakers are continuously changing the landscape when it  comes to how a company markets themselves online through the search engine  space</p>
<p>If you are going to market yourself in the search engine  space it is important to realize that things are always changing and you have  to be willing to change right along with them. Even if something changes that  you are not happy with you have no choice but to go with it otherwise you run  the risk of falling behind. Staying up to date with new technologies and web  platforms is very important because as they change so does the search engine  marketing industry.</p>

Because of their ease-of-use and zero cost, many   people have come to rely heavily on these solutions.</p>
<p>Yet   like all things in life, <a href="http://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-analytics-metrics-monitor-the-seo-progress/25493/">Google Analytics</a> isn&#8217;t without flaws, and users should take its downsides into consideration before placing all their data in one Google basket.   Here are the nine sins of Google Analytics that may have you thinking   twice:</p>
<h2>1. All Your Data are Belong to&nbsp;Us</h2>
<p>This   has been a contentious point with many Google Analytics users, as they   fear their information will be exploited or sold to third parties since it is being compiled by a company   that offers other related applications, like <a href="http://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-adwords-overhaul/20410/">Google AdWords</a>, that could use it.</p>
<h2>2. Trouble Getting&nbsp;Support</h2>
<p>While   there are options for finding solutions to problems with Google   Analytics, they aren&#8217;t always from reliable technicians, unless you want to   pay. Unfortunately, the only <a href="http://www.kissinsights.com">online customer service</a> offered is from other users like yourself. Attempting to find valid answers in a forum can be hair-pulling and futile, while using the Google Analytics Authorized   Consultants can be costly.</p>
<h2>3. Mediocre&nbsp;Reporting</h2>
<p>Google Analytics is free and they say you get what you pay for, but the limited reporting features are frustrating nonetheless. Reports aren&#8217;t as customizable as those   featured in other competitive solutions. For example, the conversion data is provided in   percentages instead of actual figures.</p>
<h2>4. Limits to Defined&nbsp;Variables</h2>
<p>Google   Analytics only allows for one user-defined variable for segmentation.   While there are steps to get around this problem, they are tedious.</p>
<h2>5. Slow Data&nbsp;Delivery</h2>
<p>You may not always need to receive data on a real-time basis, but when you do, waiting hours on end to retrieve important information can prove   taxing.</p>
<h2>6. Lack of Log&nbsp;Files</h2>
<p>Having   the ability to call your analytical history is a major advantage. While   data is stored on Google&#8217;s servers, it isn&#8217;t readily accessible for the   user, which is frustrating when settings are changed. Other analytics programs   that support log files feature filters for added analytical capability.</p>
<h2>7. No&nbsp;Spiders</h2>
<p>For   the SEO professionals, seeing the moves of spiders, or automated   browsers, is just as essential as actual human web surfers. Since Google   Analytics only supports browsers using JavaScript, it won&#8217;t track   spiders.</p>
<h2>8. Paid Campaigns Erroneously Show as&nbsp;Free</h2>
<p>Google   Analytics offers auto tagging capability to track paid or organic   traffic, but unless campaign tracking links are used, the paid campaigns   will appear free.</p>
<h2>9. Revenue From Email&nbsp;Unknown</h2>
<p>For   eCommerce users, if you want to find out the generated revenue from   your house email or its influence on conversion rates, you will have to   use campaign-tracking codes.</p>
<p><strong><br />
CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>For   the basic user, Google Analytics will likely be quite satisfactory, and is probably ideal for the majority. But   for more advanced users, such as those that need greater volumes of data to be   processed and with more detailed analysis, Google Analytics definitely has its   limits. Based on its shortcomings, what alternatives do you propose? Please leave a comment to discuss.</p>

But if you don&#8217;t have access to professional and premium SEO tools, how do you find out this kind of information?</p>
<p>Here are five free tools to get you started in finding a variety of keywords being used by your competitors.  These tools will help you see what keywords bring them traffic as well as other interesting details that can help your SEO campaign.</p>
<h2>1. SEOmoz Term&nbsp;Extractor</h2>
<p>To use this tool, you will need to register for a <a href="https://www.seomoz.org/users/register" target="_blank">free account at SEOmoz</a>.   You will then have access to this tool as well as a variety of their other <a href="http://www.stayonsearch.com/14-free-seo-tools-and-resources-from-seomoz" target="_blank">free SEO tools</a>.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;re logged in, head over to the <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/tools" target="_blank">SEO Tools</a> section and choose the <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/term-extractor" target="_blank">Term Extractor</a>.  Enter the URL of your competitor to receive one word, two work, and three word phrases the website is targeting as well as the HTML elements those terms are found in on the website.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.searchenginejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/seomoz-term-extractor.jpg" alt="SEOmoz Term Extractor Keyword Tool" width="450" height="364" /></p>
<p>Needless to say, the bottom area is a good way to learn some on-site optimization tips as well!</p>
<h2>2. Open Site&nbsp;Explorer</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.opensiteexplorer.org" target="_blank">Open Site Explorer</a> also falls under the SEOmoz tools umbrella, so once you&#8217;re logged in to SEOmoz, you have access to this as well.  To use this tool for keyword ideas, enter the competitor&#8217;s URL and go to the Anchor Text Distribution tab.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.searchenginejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/open-site-explorer.jpg" alt="SEOmoz Open Site Explorer Keyword Tool" width="450" height="330" /></p>
<p>This will show you up to 20 of the keywords that your competitor uses for anchor text when link building, hence letting you know what they are targeting and how strong their link building campaign is with the number of root domains and links using that anchor text.</p>
<h2>3. Google AdWords Keyword&nbsp;Tool</h2>
<p>I know, I know, we all know about <a href="https://AdWords.google.com/select/KeywordToolExternal" target="_blank">Google AdWords Keyword Tool</a>.  Usually I use the type in a word and let it make suggestions for me aspect, but for this exercise, I entered a domain to see what would happen.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.searchenginejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/google-adwords-keyword-tool.jpg" alt="Google AdWords Keyword Tool" width="450" height="235" /></p>
<p>The key is to go to the Columns, and check <em>Extracted From Webpage</em>.  Then you will find that if you entered domain.com, it focuses on a particular page from the domain, and not the domain homepage.  So if there isn&#8217;t a domain.com/index.html or other similar type of page, you won&#8217;t get the homepage&#8217;s keyword suggestions.  But for other specific pages on the site, you can pin down the keywords that AdWords recognizes from those</p>
<h2>4.&nbsp;SEMRush</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.semrush.com" target="_blank">SEMRush</a> allows you to enter a domain and view ten of the top keywords that the website ranks for organically, showing the keyword, position in search results, traffic percentage, and other useful information, especially if you are going to use CPC for your website.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.searchenginejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/semrush-keyword-tool.jpg" alt="SEMRush Keyword Tool" width="450" height="206" /></p>
<p>It also shows what URL on the site ranks for the specific keyword, but I removed that column to make the image fit in the space above.</p>
<h2>5.&nbsp;Alexa</h2>
<p>Aside from just giving you your traffic score, <a href="http://www.alexa.com" target="_blank">Alexa</a> also gives you the chance to see keyword queries that bring a high percent of traffic to a particular URL.  Just go to the <a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo" target="_blank">Site Info</a> tab and enter your competitor&#8217;s URL.  Once you <em>Get Details</em>, go to the <em>Search Analytics</em> tab to see top queries driving traffic to the site, and keywords that are on the rise / decline.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.searchenginejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/alexa-keyword-search-analytics.jpg" alt="Alexa Keywords in Search Analytics" width="450" height="470" /></p>
<p>If you scroll down from here, you will also find lengthy lists of keyword phrases for high impact search queries for the URL, search engine marketing activity based on ads for particular keywords, and additional keyword opportunities that the competitor (or you) could pursue.</p>
<h3><strong>Your Free Tool Suggestions</strong></h3>

However, this amazing tool is often an expensive investment choice  for small business organizations that struggles with proper budget solution.</p>
<p>SEO being an experimental art of regular testing and  optimizing, these websites find it nearly impossible to afford SEO packages to  rank and maintain their search engine placement. Therefore, these small  business organizations become the seasonal buyers of SEO companies, whose next  purchase depends highly on their budget. The best suggestion for such business  organizations is to implement some immortal SEO techniques by themselves if not  all.</p>
<p>Although, such SEO  implementation from a layperson may not help them to rank on the first page but  can add something useful. Therefore, whenever you afford your next SEO package,  even a least optimization can help your business boost and rank.</p>
<p>SEO at some parts are critical and so it is better to hand  it over to professionals but for blogging or article marketing; basic SEO  knowledge of quality keyword and the density can do more.</p>
<h2>Blogging:</h2>
<p>Blogging has become an essential part for better SEO boost  ups. If you do not have a blog for your website, then I strongly suggest you to  have one because blog satisfies two crucial things for better ranking ; original  content for search engines and updated stories for consumers.</p>
<p><strong><em>Original Content for Search Engines:</em></strong></p>
<p>The main motive of search engines is to provide quality  information to its users. Thus, in the mess of thousands of websites competing  in your niche, one effective way to rank better is by supplying quality content  regularly in your website; the more your pages and contents are indexed the  probability of better ranking and gaining fine visibility increases.</p>
<p>Furthermore, adding original contents regularly even compels  search engines to crawl your website frequently. Hence, better blogging with  quality-concerned contents is one strong reason for gaining better page rank  and placement in SERP. Trace one of the renowned blog in your niche and find  out its updates in a day, it is at least two or three times in a day, if you  cannot update twice it is still worth updating once a day.</p>
<p><strong><em>Update Stories for Consumers:</em></strong></p>
<p>Updating and advertising your consumers is one excellent way  to attract and grab them to your products, and blog helps you to do this more  effectively.  Update your content with  latest news and information that are more likely to help and notify your  consumers, encourage them to subscribe, and response to their comments. Your  consumers may or may not buy from you lately but this will surely make you the  first option when they need kind products you offer.</p>
<p>Moreover, writing about your own products and services will  make yourself known to those areas where your consumers are likely to find  themselves in trouble and what they comment in your blog is all the feedbacks  that helps you to improve your products.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>Remember: </em></strong>it is highly recommended  that your blog primary goal be your readers and not search engines. Although,  it is essential to place major keywords and key-phrases but do not make your  blog lifeless. If you have a WordPress blog than use appropriate keywords that  dominates your content, do not use unrelated keyword tags because it simply  confuses and dilutes your content and loses proper visibility.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Online&nbsp;Interactions:</h2>
<p>Promote your website and blog in social networking websites  like Facebook and Twitter. Social networking websites helps you to reach your  consumers around the globe and assists you to create your own network in your  niche. Today, social networking websites has becomes one of the most powerful  SEO-SEM strategies for any online business. Thus, join such networking places  where you can easily promote your products, services because they are the  strong source of traffic, and needs no proper SEO knowledge, but little  socializing and marketing skills.</p>
<p>Furthermore, reach to your competitor’s blog and find out  what they are up to? On the other hand, find out probable blogs that shares a  common theme with you. Making such interactions can truly help building strong network,  and aware them about your business. Exchanging contents and blog them, it can  mutually help to rank better. Similarly, it is always a good idea to join  forums where many lost consumers seeks helps from experts; being a part of  forums and guiding them through their problems can amazingly help you drive  more traffic to your website and make them aware about your existence in the  internet world. Similarly, engaging in such forms can even help you with better  rankings without actually performing any SEO tasks.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>Remember:</em> </strong>Social networking websites are open marketing and  advertising places &#8211; beside your personnel account&#8211; your consumer might be happy  with your services or mad, so, it is always better to take their comments as a  constructive criticism and never write anything offensive because your amateur  behavior can ruin your impression among your customers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, we often see in forums where people perform  unethical marketing like posting unnecessary links as a solution or if the user  is from your competitor’s product than cursing them later suggesting their own  websites. Avoid such practices as it simply breaks your brand name and image in  the public.</p>
<h2>Guest&nbsp;Blogging:</h2>
<p>An easy way to accumulate quality links for those who can  write is guest blogging, and if you are blogging for your own products and  services then it is a better job for links to do. Guest blogging is simply  blogging for other blogs at the bloggers will, and if you can pass this than  you are likely to earn quality links and quality traffic without any begging  link exchange emails.</p>
<p>Discover some good blogs in your niche and find out if they  allow guest posting and guest blogging. Although, in some blog, quality  bloggers are always welcome, whereas, in some other blogs, they mention if they  need someone to replace them while they are out for vacation or wedding. So,  just email them with a link of your own blog and a sample article. If you are  not hired then you can use it for your own blog and if you are hired than your  writings can earn traffic and rankings with a quality tag. Search engines rate  such links high and is one strong techniques of SEO for better ranking and  traffic.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Remember:</strong> <a href="http://myblogguest.com/">Guest  blogging</a> is offer only if your writing skill can meet the need. So, write with  patience and be careful about the punctuations and grammatical errors. It is  also suggested to make your content simple and up to the level because the  readers are new and if you cannot meet their expectations than you are likely  to lose a good opportunity.</p></blockquote>

<p>Keywords are the foundation on which the whole structure of SEO is based on. The user searches in the keywords and the search engines execute their search algorithms on the basis of these keywords. Hence, the selection of keywords and keyword research is what  the SEO journey starts with.</p>
<p>The main objective of ranking high on organic search and thereby getting targeted traffic can be achieved much faster by targeting the Long Tail Keywords. Long Tail Keywords are phrases with more than three or four words specifying the product or service that you offer. Any well planned SEO campaign first focuses attention on long tail keywords which are more specific rather than generic keywords or head terms.</p>
<p><em>(Note from the Editor: Also, go though this discussion on whether <a href="http://www.searchenginejournal.com/is-long-tail-seo-really-seo/27906/">Long Tail  is SEO</a> by <a title="Alan Bleiweiss's Website" href="http://searchmarketingwisdom.com">Alan Bleiweiss</a>) </em></p>
<p><strong>For Example:</strong></p>
<p>If the website in question is about Edible oil then see the no. of results Google displays for various key phrases as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Search Query &#8211; [Edible oil]:</strong></p>
<p><img src="http://www.searchenginejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/long-tail-01.jpg" alt="" width="516" height="186" /></p>
<p><strong>Search Query &#8211; [Edible oil refining]:</strong></p>
<p><img src="http://www.searchenginejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/long-tail-02.jpg" alt="" width="525" height="179" /></p>
<p><strong>Search Query &#8211; [Edible oil refining company]:</strong></p>
<p><img src="http://www.searchenginejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/long-tail-03.jpg" alt="" width="536" height="176" /></p>
<p>As you can see that the number of results being displayed get reduced if you have a longer phrase &#8211; which (<em>usually</em>) means the competitiveness decreases and the potential of ranking increases if you are targeting for a longer keyword.</p>
<p>If you focus only on generic keywords or head terms, the rankings will take more time and in the meanwhile you lose out on the targeted traffic, which the site may have got as a result of ranking for long tail keywords. On the other hand if the long tail keywords are targeted in due course, the site starts ranking for the head terms and the site shows an increase in targeted traffic over a period of time indicating progress.</p>
<p>Research on search behavior has proved that the searchers are becoming more specific in their queries and keying in long tail keywords more as this saves their time. Google Instant has also given an impetus to the long tail searches as the long tail keyword suggestions offered by Google as the searcher types the query is easy to select and search for.</p>
<p>Hence, setting the priority for long tail over head terms is surely more sensible as this will show an increasing and a progressive trend in the traffic in your analytic reports and help you to get visibility on search much earlier.</p>
<p>If the client wants to target the local market then the long tail keywords having a local intent reduce the competition much further and increases the chances of the website to rank high in the SERPs as soon the site gets indexed.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.searchenginejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/long-tail-04.jpg" alt="" width="511" height="171" /></p>
<p>But, the main challenge in selecting the long tail phrases is to work out the right combination of words which will bring the targeted traffic right from the early stage of the SEO campaign keeping in mind the content of the site.</p>

With social networks growing and expanding wildly, Google has decided to get its share of the action. It all started with the launch of Google&#8217;s Social Search as a beta for English speaking users. Social Search was previously in the Google Labs section. It displays its results at the bottom of the search window, and searches based on your list of contacts in Google, for relevant information to the topic you are currently researching.</p>
<p>It then posts whatever photos, posts, blogs or links the people in your social network have posted on your topic. An added feature allows your friends photos that relate to your topic to be published.</p>
<p>In a major update, Google has almost completely overhauled the Social Search network. <strong><a href="http://mashable.com/2011/02/17/google-social-search-2/">The company has added Twitter, Flickr, and Quora</a> to its servers</strong>, integrating all the information available on all those websites into one place. Now Social Search results will appear anywhere in the listing according to search relevance. Annotations will let you know when someone from your social circle has posted any kind of information relevant to your search, and on which website it was posted.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.searchenginejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/google-social.jpg" alt="Google Social" width="540" height="307" /></p>
<p>This will change the appearance and function of the search engine. <strong>Search results from the people in your networks can appear anywhere on the page, complete with photos.</strong> For example if you are searching for information on “babies” you might get links to your friends baby shots. This might be a good thing, but might get a little top heavy if too many people in your social network post on a topic. You will then find yourself having to wade through all the information, for that which is actually useful.</p>
<p>With the release of this update will come some changes as Google tries to blend the social networks into one big one. <strong>New links near the results will take you to your social network&#8217;s address book, and to a list of pages and links that might be relevant to your search topic</strong>. It is hoped this integration will streamline the social network experience as it continues to grow. But this is a beta product, and right now more emphasis has been placed on information then aesthetics so don&#8217;t expect a pretty picture all the time.</p>
<p>With the new and improved Social Search, users now have more control over their user options when it comes to connecting a public network to Google. Not only will users be able to connect publicly, but there is also a private option available for those wishing to be careful about who they expose their identity to. There is also a feature which suggests which networks are likely to be of interest to you based on your list of contacts, and the sites they are on.</p>
<p>As more and more people discover the wealth of information at their fingertips today, the more they turn to centralized places and services to find that information. Google is taking advantage of that fact, with this new move. One glaring exception to the rule here is Facebook. You won&#8217;t be seeing them here anytime soon though, they are contracted through Bing. But this is a step in the right direction for Google, who wants to expand on their share of the Internet market. Jokes have been made on other websites about how all the media websites were going to be combined into one. Well looks like Google is the one laughing the loudest now. They have fired the first shot in the social network war. Look for other popular search engines to try similar approaches.</p>

<p>One of my unloved toys (because I lack time), <a href="http://whoicompete.com/">WhoICompete</a> is a free tool to generate the list of your strongest competitors in Google.</p>
<p>The search results are presented in form of a table where you can see:</p>
<ul>
<li>The list of domains ranked for the specified terms;</li>
<li>The number of &#8220;Overlaps&#8221; (how many terms is the domain ranked for);</li>
<li>&#8220;Details&#8221; link</li>
<li>Some SEO-relevant statistics for advanced usage.</li>
</ul>

<p>The tool has some nifty features which were added on users&#8217; feedback:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can target results by country (tested by non-US users with positive feedback);</li>
<li>Generate some SEO-relevant information for each domain or page in the list (like Google home page PageRank, Alexa Rank, etc);</li>
<li><strong>Export the whole table to Excel</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Clicking the &#8220;Details&#8221; links brings you to the list of all subpages from the current domain that got ranked high for the search phrased provided:</p>

Moreover,  judging from today’s release of their version 2.3 Beta, it looks as if the  Scandinavian startup is ramping up for some more accolades for 2011. While  Version 2.3 is not a <em>Noah’s Ark</em> of  online travel exclusivity, users will find adding just about anything to their  travel guides, and their community too, quite useful.</p>
<p>For those who are not familiar with Stay.com, the travel  startup from Norway ended up as one of the top   5 <a href="http://www.time.com/time/video/player/0,32068,596049437001_2013814,00.html">Time  Magazine</a> picks for 2010. I talked <a href="http://www.searchenginejournal.com/stay-travel-engine/21691/">about them</a> a bit after the initial Beta launch back in June, 2010. Besides the cleanest  user interface around, and beautiful aesthetics, the platform allows users to  create very well tailored travel guides for reviewing online or downloading  into super nice PDF format. Enough said about old news.</p>
<p>This current version of Stay.com released today offers users  the opportunity to add whatever they so desire to their customized travel  guides via a nice variation on the Google Places API. And while this may seem a  fairly ordinary added value, the search component of this feature is  particularly interesting.</p>
<p>In the screen below you can easily see Stay.com affords the  users there great flexibility by allowing them to search within the Stay  platform, while building guides or doing travel homework, anything that Google  Places touches. The next few screenshots from within the Stay.com platform show  at least one search/addition aspect. Users can add venues, sites, attractions,  almost anything to the new Stay guides, but as importantly, to the community  &amp; platform of the development (more later on this).</p>
<p><img src="http://www.searchenginejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/berlin-starbucks.jpg" alt="Berlin Starbucks Image" width="540" height="354" /></p>
<p>While building or researching information within a city, the  new Stay version lets users either search a term (place), or just pinpoint and  add one at their discretion. As the image above shows too, annotating,  categorizing, adding to guides, and even sharing via several channels is  possible – on the guide level, as well as the item level.</p>
<p>Just like the Stay.com that won accolades last year, the  developers in the far frozen North have again laid the groundwork for some very  powerful traveler value. The image below shows just one view of the special  “add feature” just before the user saves it to his/he guide, etc.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.searchenginejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/berlin-starbucks-map.jpg" alt="Berlin Starbucks map image" width="540" height="297" /></p>
<p>As stated, Stay.com Version 2.3 is not the “end all” startup  release of all time. It is however, significant for two basic reasons. First,  Stay.com has if anything, been all about completeness from the start – Version  2.3 shows meticulous value building. Secondly, considering what we are told is  a beautiful mobile facet to Stay.com, adding desired destinations (later images  and even video) seems the next logical step. What would you want an online  travel service to be able to help you with?</p>
<p>The image below is one I made to illustrate how users can  just define and add even the most obscure venues. The Google Places map below  has been zoomed and switched to Hybrid – so adding this Spree River tour is  about as easy as aiming a smart phone camera – ooops! I spilled the beans  maybe?</p>
<p><img src="http://www.searchenginejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/berlin-river-tour-add.jpg" alt="Berlin Spree River image" width="540" height="388" /></p>
<p>Perhaps I am reading a bit too much into what Stay.com is  showing off this time around. However, taking note of the developmental  doggedness where so content is concerned. I alluded to this at the start of  this article. Stay differentiates itself from almost all other travel startups  by using so much professionally generated guide info. It can be said Stay.com  is the Frommers of online travel guides. No other such startup I am aware of  has such editorial content. Now add the ability for users to create their own  variants (not simple reviews) and its easy to see a powerful combination of  variables here.</p>
<p>CEO Joachim Paasch had this to say via a release about content:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“We wanted to create  something useful and original all along. It appears now we discover how right  the decision was to create custom venues and travel descriptions. With “Add your  own” Stay.com will become a much more powerful travel service.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Factoring in Google’s situation where <a href="http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/algorithm-change-launched/">SPAM</a> and  content are concerned, and what we have on good advice is a very advanced  mobile aspect for Stay.com – and perhaps you see my reason for sounding so  optimistic here. Stay.com, or anyone else for the matter, has to consider where  the Web is headed with content – what was “King” may soon become out and out  Master <em>of the Universe</em>.</p>
<p>Stay.com version 2.3 also throws in a neat Facebook Connect  aspect, as well as 8 or more new cities and hundreds of hotels and venues. But,  meticulous and complete information, top-notch aesthetics and user interfaces,  the widest possible flexibility with the least clutter, and extreme mobility  when it’s called for – this is what has so far differentiated Stay.com. If the  mobile app up next is as good as we hear, all that’s left for the boys from  Norway is the execution. We wait and see.</p>

<p><strong>1)</strong><strong> Please give us your background and  tell us what you do for a living.</strong></p>
<p>In January 2011, I left a six year stint at the New York Times  Company, as Director of Search Strategy. That involved management of a very  large SEO program, encompassing both <a href="http://www.nytimes.com">NYTimes.com</a> as well as <a href="http://www.boston.com">The Boston Globe</a> website. In  addition, I was Co-Founder/COO of Define Search Strategies, a small consulting  branch of the New York Times that worked with companies to build SEO  foundations similar to those we created at the Times. That provided a lot of  experience in different competitive categories: News, travel, e-commerce,  health, sports media, retail and mobile.</p>
<p>In January 2011, I left to start <a href="http://www.audiencewise.com/">AudienceWise</a>, a search marketing solutions  company based in Portland, OR. AudienceWise is founded on the concept of <a href="http://www.briansolis.com/2011/01/the-time-has-come-for-holistic-business-strategy/">holistic  business strategy</a>, as it applies to search and online visibility. Every  truly successful SEO/SEM/Social Media effort I&#8217;ve seen has all been intelligently  tied together with all the other elements of a company&#8217;s marketing strategy.  Our goal is move search and social marketing out of the realm of tactical, and  gain a seat at the &#8216;Big Idea&#8217; table.</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong><strong> Someone might tell you that  Enterprise Level SEO needs to be done by a large SEO company.  As a small  shop, how would you respond to that?</strong></p>
<p>I think it all depends on who ends up doing the work, whether  it&#8217;s a big agency or a small shop. The closer you are to the true expertise at  a consulting firm, the better. I&#8217;ve heard tales of an SEO expert being there  for the sales process, the kickoff meeting, and then disappearing when the real  work begins. That&#8217;s not going to be very useful when faced the hundreds of  strategic SEO decisions that need to be made over the course of the campaign.</p>
<p>My experience has been that the strongest Enterprise SEO  consulting work is often done by small shop or independent SEOs that take on a smaller  handful of clients. Unfortunately, this group of seasoned veterans is often  booked many months in advance and they don&#8217;t come cheap. Ultimately, your best  bet is to find someone who will be doing the work that has a proven track  record specifically <strong><em>in your market</em></strong>. It&#8217;s a great idea to hire based on experience  in a particular vertical, because you&#8217;ll save a ton of money and resources not  guessing where the opportunities are and which tactics will work. If you&#8217;re a  company with a lot of brick and mortar, you don&#8217;t want to hire me for Local  SEO. You want to hire <a href="http://www.davidmihm.com/">David Mihm</a> or <a href="http://www.blumenthals.com/">Mike Blumenthal</a>.</p>
<p><strong>3)</strong><strong> What are some typical objections  in the Enterprise SEO Sales Process and how do you answer them?</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>First and foremost, it&#8217;s  expensive. That&#8217;s because it combines three talent sets: market experience, SEO  acumen, and project management skills that cross a number of corporate  departments. You need to be fluent in Executive, Marketing, IT, Sales, and  Editorial/Content languages. Hopefully you can stay out of the HR department.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot of demand for the folks described above, and  there&#8217;s not exactly a ton of them with a proven track record. Strategic SEO at  the Enterprise level often results in decisions that can have a six or seven figure  impact, and in some cases can make or break an online marketing strategy. It&#8217;s  usually worth it to pay more to hire someone who can prove they can generate  results at that level.</p>
<p>The other big objection is the resources and time needed for an  Enterprise SEO campaign to truly succeed. Unless the site or network of sites  is a total mess, there&#8217;s not going to be exponential traffic growth in 30 days.  High performing sites are typically the result of many months of careful SEO  execution.</p>
<p><strong>4)</strong><strong> Issues of “website control” are  endemic to all SEO engagements, but especially Enterprise SEO  engagements.  How do you communicate to the client stakeholders that you  need a certain level of control in order to facilitate the desired outcomes?</strong></p>
<p>The online landscape is littered with companies that fail to  execute search strategy because of roadblocks in the Marketing department, with  the tech folks, or even at the executive level. Why even bother shelling out  for SEO if you&#8217;re not going to support it? You may as well increase your  offline media buys, or bump up the paid search budget. If you&#8217;re embarking on  or rebuilding your online SEO strategy, make sure it&#8217;s a corporate mandate from  top to bottom. Even if that happens, you&#8217;ll have to demonstrate the value of  almost every SEO project you embark on. Two big strategies here: Accurately  projecting ballpark ROI for individual projects, and highlighting how your  competitors are successfully employing a tactic.</p>
<p>Fairly often the control issues will be with the tech teams. They&#8217;ve  usually learned a lot of the ropes as far as SEO is concerned, either at the Enterprise  level or working on their own sites. You have to approach them with that in  mind. If you start &#8216;educating&#8217; them about how search engine crawlers work and  how keywords are important, that will likely be the last time they listen to  you. They know enough SEO to be fluent. What they don&#8217;t usually have time to do  is process the relentless flood of new information in our industry or pay  attention to what competitors are doing. Highlighting the important news,  either in meetings or newsletters or email, is one of the better ways to prove  value to them. Providing analysis on how industry developments apply to the  company is your measure of worth as an in-house SEO or outside consultant. For  example, your tech group might read about how <a href="http://searchengineland.com/googles-proposal-for-crawling-ajax-may-be-live-34411">Google  has a plan to crawl AJAX</a>. It&#8217;s up to you as the SEO stakeholder to assess  whether that undertaking is worth it given the upside for your company. Believe  me, taking a few non-essential undertakings off of the tech team&#8217;s plate will  get you a lot further in the long run than &#8216;educating&#8217; them. It goes a long way  to establishing trust.</p>
<p>As far as project communication goes, I&#8217;m a firm believer in the  &#8216;Grief Sandwich&#8217; methodology. The bad news is firmly ensconced within two  pristine slices of good news. Example:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, those Google News sitemaps are working great! Our  number of indexed articles is way up and Google News traffic is up 35% week  over week. Bad news on the image search front though&#8230;the editors still can&#8217;t create  optimized ALT tags when they publish images. We need to change that in the CMS  as soon as possible so we don&#8217;t continue to lose image search traffic. However,  when we do have properly tagged images, we often get the picture result in  Google News or one of the top image results in Google Image Search for relevant  keyword, so that project has a ton of upside.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>5)</strong><strong> Many will argue that SEO for Small  Business and Enterprise SEO are two totally different animals.  Your  thoughts?</strong></p>
<p>Thinking back, I recall this <a href="http://www.searchenginejournal.com/gign't/23222/">Small Business SEO vs.  Enterprise SEO</a> conversation before. I tend to agree that from a daily  tactical standpoint, they can look very different. Small businesses or  independent webmasters will often spend more time on link building outreach, leadgen,  content creation, domaining, and keyword cycling. Enterprise SEOs might spend  their day creating strategies for site architecture changes, consulting on CMS  changes, and training content creators. Or as I like to call it, &#8216;death by  meetings&#8217;.</p>
<p>However, I think each camp has quite a bit to learn from one  another. The same tactics that work on a micro  level at a small business are often overlooked by bigger organizations. It&#8217;s surprising  how effective even a small amount of targeted link building can bring momentum  to a new content launch at a big site. On the other side of the fence,  Enterprise SEO campaigns can yield a goldmine of valuable market and user data.  To accurately profile defensible traffic in a particular vertical, there&#8217;s no  substitute for data from a large site or network.</p>
<p>The above article from last year hits on what I said in  question two, but says it a bit differently. Hiring an SEO is a bit like hiring  a lawyer based on specialty. Relevant experience in a market is key. Different  competitive search spaces like travel, media, and health can require different  approaches.</p>
<p><strong>6)</strong><strong> How can a new company with a new  domain effectively gain traction in the SERPS?</strong></p>
<p>In most cases, I think a good start is to allocate a paid  search budget. You can hone down your keyword targeting to get a better idea of  what converts, as well as get a better sense of the competitive landscape. At  the same time, the campaign should be building some visibility and traction to  the new domain. One mistake I see frequently with new companies or new sites is  that they don&#8217;t narrow down their focus out of the gate. Instead, they try to  build links to hundreds of pages or target thousands of keyword variations. A  better plan is to build a stronger, smaller SEO foundation and then expand your  keyword and link building focus from there.</p>
<p>In the last couple of years I think we&#8217;ve seen Google lighten  up on new domains, likely as a result of them turning down the domain weight  factor. Not too long ago, I&#8217;d advise clients that launching a new domain  instead of just adding a directory or subdomain to your established brand was  like launching a Viking funeral ship. These days, I&#8217;m hearing less about new  site invisibility for the first few months post-launch, and <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/googles-sandbox-still-exists-exemplified-by-gradercom">whispers  of the Sandbox bogeyman</a> have dissipated to some degree. Any &#8220;sandbox  effect&#8221; now is likely the result of launching with a low quality link  profile or a mess on the site or network (like the one detailed in the comments  of that SEOMoz article).</p>
<p>Another common story you hear about new domains is that they  rank after launch, then slowly disappear into the depths of the SERPs. That can  be caused by a big visibility blitz followed by anemic growth or stagnation in  the link/visibility profile. You can fend this off by structuring your  post-launch marketing efforts so they don&#8217;t all happen at launch. If you can  maintain your PPC campaign and it results in continued link growth, that&#8217;s  useful too.</p>
<p><strong>7)</strong><strong> What level of client education  does an Enterprise SEO engagement necessitate in order to achieve maximum ROI?</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>A ton. Although it&#8217;s not  a secret, the level of SEO competency across an organization is the engine that  will allow them to build a strong competitive advantage in search traffic. If  you factor in all the SEO dependencies across editorial, tech, and marketing  you might be talking about dozens or hundreds of decisions made each day that  can have a positive or negative effect. There&#8217;s no way an in-house team or a  consulting group can reasonably participate in all those decisions. That&#8217;s been  consistent within the large SEO programs I&#8217;ve been part of. Success requires  training after training, specifically focused on what part of SEO/SEM/Social  Media each team member needs to factor into their job. There&#8217;s no sense in  trying to weigh people down with the insane amount of tribal and changing knowledge  that we keep track of as SEOs. Cheat-sheets customized to their CMS or process  are also very useful.</p>
<p>Emphasis on building SEO knowledge is one thing often glossed  over in the current dustup about content farms. Companies like Mahalo, Demand  Media, and Associated Content build SEO as a fundamental requirement across  their organization. Whether you like or dislike their content quality (or their  SEO tactics), this is a great way to make sure you&#8217;re not stuck in the cycle of  having to re-optimize the site every few months and lose valuable early  visibility on new content. Early traction from optimized content also pays  dividends as time goes on. That&#8217;s how sites like About.com capture search  visibility year after year. SEO is baked into the content creation process from  the very start.</p>
<p><strong>8)</strong><strong> Can you give examples of some high  level tools that are needed to optimally perform Enterprise SEO? </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>It all depends on how  big the site or network of sites is. For small sites, you can get a good feel  for site architecture and troubleshoot obvious problems using tools like <a href="http://www.distilled.co.uk/blog/seo/understanding-site-architecture-with-xenu-and-excel/">Xenu  and Excel.</a> It won&#8217;t be as useful on massive sites, and it doesn&#8217;t factor in  external link weights. The <a href="http://www.iis.net/download/seotoolkit">Microsoft  IIS SEO toolkit</a> can be helpful, if you&#8217;re using IIS. With basic crawl and  report tools, I&#8217;m looking for bad URLs, weird developer URLs or test URLs that are  live and shouldn&#8217;t be. Enterprise sites that utilize third party hosting services  for things like images can end up with artifacts like test.domain.com or dev.domain.com  URLs. The engines can end up crawling and indexing these.</p>
<p>Stepping it up a level, there&#8217;s definitely value in using a  full-fledged platform like <a href="http://www.brightedge.com/">Brightedge</a>, <a href="http://www.covario.com/">Covario,</a> or <a href="http://www.conductor.com/">Conductor</a>. Obviously these can cost a bit,  but they do high level things like analytics integration, detailed SEO status  reports, and competitive analysis. If you&#8217;ve got enough folks that need real  time data or heavily customized reports, these are all worth exploring.  It&#8217;s good to know if they utilize a crawler or  a tagging solution. Tech teams can be sensitive about adding yet another tag to  the code.</p>
<p>For  situational stuff, I like using both the <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/tools">SEOMoz  tools</a> (particularly Open Site Explorer) and the <a href="http://tools.seobook.com/">SEOBook tools</a> (particularly the  Competitive Research Tool). I&#8217;m keen to try out <a href="http://ontolo.com/">Ontolo</a>,  to see how it can be useful on big site link building projects. Their blog has become  a must-read for me.</p>
