With all the car stuff and events that have been going on lately, we had quite a bit of stuff to catch-up on in real life so I promised May that we would be spending the weekend up in her area so that we could knock some things out. She had been wanting to reorganize her place so we took the opportunity to do so. I normally have something for you guys to read or look at on Monday but today, I must take a break. When I was younger I was one of those kids that got sick often and always had a sensitive stomach. Whatever I ate, there was a chance that my stomach wouldn&#8217;t agree with it. Through large amounts of drinking and late night mexican food sessions between the ages of 20-25, I have grown immune to many things and I just wasn&#8217;t as sensitive as I was when I was a child. Trust me, those of you that know me now think that I&#8217;m very laid back and chill but there are witnesses to attest to my destructive behavior when I was younger. Anyways, last night, I finally broke my streak of not throwing-up for over 9 years. I&#8217;m not one of those guys that you see sick very often now and I was pretty proud of myself for not vomiting through all this time, even when I used to party a lot. I was like, the fucking Lance Armstrong of not throwing up, haha, if that makes sense. Well on Sunday, I ate some bad chicken and I really fucked myself. May had eaten it with me as well and she didn&#8217;t feel very well early on, but I didn&#8217;t think anything of it because I was fine. The rest of the day, I started to feel worse and worse. I hurt my back a little while back after Wekfest so I just thought it was the back pain that was acting up, but my stomach started to feel very odd and I started to get pretty strong headaches throughout the day. We went to Target and bought some things for the house and when I got back, I took an Excedrin and a Gas-X pill, to help with the headache and the quizzy stomach. I felt a little better and May and I enjoyed some TV time and then she went to bed. Before she fell asleep, she told me to take a shower before I went back to my own place as she thought that it would make me feel better or at least a bit refreshed. I forgot to mention that throughout the day, I had been extremely cold and had the chills even though I was really warm and May checked to see if I had a fever. My face was all red but I was cold as shit. I wore my NWP4Life hoodie and thought that it would make me feel better but I was like randomly hot and cold. While I was showering, I kept making the water hotter and hotter but I was still freezing cold. I began to burp a lot and I knew it was all downhill from there. I quickly got out of the shower to dry off but when I was walking to towards the towel, I got incredibly dizzy and almost fell to the floor. Things were not good. I rarely ever get like that so I sat down on the toilet to regroup myself. I really didn&#8217;t want to throw-up because I absolutely despise it and it&#8217;s such a painful thing, but I eventually gave in and knew that getting the food out would make me feel better. I haven&#8217;t yacked that hard since the last time I pounded Patron while eating Adobada Tacos. After I finished, I thought it would make me feel better but I was still shaking from having the chills. It was getting pretty late and I wanted to get home to put some orders together from The Chronicles Storefront but it just wasn&#8217;t happening. I kinda just laid on the couch and knocked out for a bit until around 2am when May came out because she heard the TV in the living room still on. I assured her that I would be okay and I made the drive back and here I am now. I sincerely apologize for not giving you guys something car-related or anything interesting to read for that matter, but I still feel a bit under the weather so I am going to lay down now and hope I feel better in a couple hours. Thanks to May for taking care of me and being so worried. I&#8217;m usually the one that&#8217;s trying to take care of her and make sure that everything is okay, so she was a bit freaked out to see me in such bad shape. In all the time that we&#8217;ve been together, she&#8217;s never even seen me sick because I try my best to take care of myself. Anyways, I&#8217;m off now. I&#8217;m pretty sure either May is going to call me when she sees this, or my mother is going to be calling me. Yes, she does read this site, and she reads EVERYTHING. Haha&#8230; Stickydiljoe, human afterall&#8230;.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m out for today. See you guys tomorrow&#8230;</p>

Wiring harness extraordinaire Ryan Basseri, better known to our world as Rywire, is now officially calling Southern California his permanent home. He decided to finally make the move down in 2011 after deciding to go full-on with the expansion of his brand name and company. He now has a sizable shop space that gives him room to finally have a dedicated work space and area for him to store his products. He&#8217;s starting to push more product out now and make his shop a full-on one-stop shop for everything wiring-related, as well as supplying other essentials like engine management and alternative options for ignition control.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="r1" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5050/5269016566_24e3af4def_o.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>I mention this because Ryan is close friend of mine and I recently went down to the shop to help him shoot some photos for his products. He&#8217;s not too far away from me so I&#8217;m always down to cruise by if he needs a hand. DPK David also works for him now and so if you ever call Rywire and hear a voice that doesn&#8217;t sound like Ryan&#8217;s, it&#8217;s David. They&#8217;re busy still reorganizing the site and adding new items often but if you guys need anything for your car that&#8217;s wiring or electronics-specific, Rywire is the place to call. I believe in what this guy does because I&#8217;ve seen his work first hand on more than one occassion. I hear some guys out there that like to talk shit or whatever about how you can do wiring yourself, or one of your fucking homies can do wiring, or only nutriders use Rywire products because of the name, and hey, that&#8217;s all fine and dandy. If you feel like you or one of your friends can do wiring that&#8217;s fine. When it comes to something that is important and/or essential to keep your car running in optimal condition, such as anything electronic, I would prefer to go to someone that specializes in it and has wired up cars for a living. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with spending good money on product. It&#8217;s bothersome to go on internet forums and see people talk about stuff they don&#8217;t know anything about. &#8220;Oh why are you getting Rywire stuff? _________ down the street can do it.&#8221; or whatever and these people have probably never actually used quality product. Sometimes people even use that shit as leverage to try to make money off unsuspecting consumers. &#8220;Oh you don&#8217;t need to go to Rywire, I&#8217;ll &#8216;sponsor&#8217; you and do it cheaper.&#8221; Yeah and he&#8217;ll hook you up with a drink while he&#8217;s tearing your car apart in the dark at his mom&#8217;s house in the backyard. You get what I&#8217;m saying? That&#8217;s like somebody saying &#8220;oh why are you going to watch the Iron Man movie? ________down the street can act like Iron Man.&#8221; The fuck? Sure he can probably act like it but it doesn&#8217;t mean that it&#8217;s going to be better. These people do it professionally and have experience in that field. That&#8217;s like saying &#8220;oh why are you watching porn for? _______down the street can fuck this girl and make a movie out of it.&#8221; Okay, that may be the case, but there are professionals out there that do it because it is their expertise. Pornstars get paid to fuck. You don&#8217;t watch your friend fuck because, like engine harnesses, things don&#8217;t always fit right or look right if you don&#8217;t have experience putting things in certain places. Either the angles are off, or something doesn&#8217;t fit correctly, and sometimes, things are just plain sloppy. I say this because it&#8217;s true, and because I can basically compare anything life-related to porn and/or Saved by the Bell(Not the Ms. Bliss Years). Rywire is not a professional love maker, but he will make love to your engine harness and your car&#8217;s engine bay will look awesome. Haha, I don&#8217;t think it can be said any better. You shouldn&#8217;t be watching your friends fuck anyway, because that&#8217;s just weird. This isn&#8217;t really an advertisement either because there really isn&#8217;t any need to. The man&#8217;s work speaks for itself. There&#8217;s a reason why so many of the top builds in the industry use his stuff. Sometimes he&#8217;s so focused on work that even when we hang out and try to get him to talk to asian girls he&#8217;s still talking about work. He&#8217;s a madman, but in a good way&#8230;.</p>
<p>Anyways, here&#8217;s the product pictures I took. The first time I went to go shoot some stuff for him, I brought on the whole fucking calvalry and had like independent lighting, a fucking sound stage, extension cords, all kinds of photography equipment. That proved to be terribly unnecessary because some of the pictures might have been over exposed, or big shadows were cast. This time around, we just shot in a smaller room where I was able to just use a smaller, 580ex Canon flash and it worked out much better.

We have birthdays that are a couple days apart and since everyone was busy catching up on things after coming back from Wekfest, we just decided to celebrate both birthdays all at once at Northwood Pizza (NWP). It wasn&#8217;t really like a huge planned thing and was pretty last minute but I was surprised by how many people came out and I was happy to see everyone that came out. It was pouring rain that night which made it even harder for some to make it, but we made a great night of it and just hung out to eat pizza and chill&#8230;</p>

<p>May went ahead and reserved the private room that they had at Northwood and it was a good idea because we were pretty loud and obnoxious&#8230;</p>

<p>The pizza is always really good there but I had eaten so much throughout the week that I just ended up ordering a sandwich and some wings&#8230;</p>

<p>May used her usual baking prowess to whip up a topless titty cake. The angle of the nipples made it kind of sketchy when we shoved the candle in one of the boobs and lit the candle&#8230;</p>

<p>Honestly, it was a little creepy when we removed the rice crispy treat-titties because it was a red velvet cake but the cake was delicous nonetheless. May actually went and did research to mix the proper ingredients to make the top layer like a flesh color. May is really into details so she went all out&#8230;</p>

<p>May cutting up cake for everyone&#8230;</p>
<p>Overall, it was a great night. Thanks to everyone for coming out and celebrating and thanks to May for making a delicious headless, armless, torso red velvet cake with huge double D rice crispy treat titties&#8230;</p>
<p>On a side note, Ross from Midnight Garage recently finished painting and mounting my JDM Nissan Cima window visors so I decided to get some updated pictures of it. The car had just been washed a couple days before but I drove it to the M&amp;M Donuts Sunday meets as well as to other random places so it got pretty dirty by the time I had a chance to take pics. It also rained like 5 minutes later so the shots aren&#8217;t the best. I&#8217;m usually all over the place covering Honda stuff so it was refreshing to finally get an opportunity to take pictures of my own car&#8230;</p>

Hopefully you guys enjoyed it thoroughly and had a chance to see how the trip went from our perspective. Everything went so smoothly and the show itself was absolutely amazing. Today&#8217;s last bit of coverage features some cars, some random bullshit, and well&#8230;some shots that will probably end up being the most clicked on of the year I&#8217;m sure, because my audience I&#8217;ve noticed, are huge pervos. Most of these pics are actually just shot from the area around my booth. By this time during the event, it had just gotten so ridiculously crowded that there was no point in me attempting to walk around to take pictures of cars. That and I had a consistent flow of people walking by to purchase stickers and shirts so I just had no time to walk around. People that I knew that wanted to hang out had to come by the booth even, and it took them quite awhile just walking from the back of the building towards the stage area, up to the booth by the entrance where I was&#8230;</p>

<p>Look at this crowd&#8230;you can barely even spot the cars because there were so many people&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="w2" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5211/5489564583_a15c57aa3b_o.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>DPK Jared was having a blast and had a couple of drinks, which usually leads to him acting a little crazy so he decided to stand at the booth and attempt to sell my merchandise by yelling at people that were walking by. As crazy as it sounds, it actually kind of worked. Well, it made for some awkward conversations with random ass people but some people actually did decide to buy something. You can see in the picture above that when Jared drinks his hand speed increases ten-fold. He was moving his arms around so fast that he eventually lifted into the sky and he flew away&#8230;</p>

<p>At one point he convinced this girl to come by and he tried to convince her to buy something even though she had probably never heard of The Chronicles before. I don&#8217;t know if she had been drinking as well or not, but she kept like, trying to fix her shirt and everytime she did that she like pulled the back of her shirt down and she was accidently showing us what was going on up front, if you know what I mean&#8230;the shirt was getting pulled down a little too low. Jared of course, didn&#8217;t notice because he was too busy waving his hands around and being a DJ in mid-air&#8230;</p>

<p>&#8230;Sheepey noticed though&#8230;</p>

<p>At one point Jared started talking to this dude that was rocking a &#8220;Crenshaw&#8221; t-shirt. Crenshaw Blvd., for those of you unfamiliar with the area, is not one of the safest and best areas to live in if you&#8217;re a resident of the Los Angeles, CA region. This guy was actually pretty cool though, I don&#8217;t remember if he bought anything because we were all a little worried that Jared was going to get stabbed or beat up&#8230;I don&#8217;t know how comfortable the guy is having Jared so close to him but Jared probably doesn&#8217;t even remember&#8230;haha&#8230;</p>

<p>Genevieve Chanelle was the headlining model at Wekfest alongside Christine Mendoza and I&#8217;m sure there are probably hundreds of pictures of her all over the net from the event, but nobody got a picture of her&#8230;</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a pretty bad picture of two other models&#8230;</p>

<p>Often times, I look up the search terms that people use to find this site and for whatever reason, I always see &#8220;Christine Mendoza nipslip&#8221; or something similar. I don&#8217;t really know how that relates to my site or how Google or other search engines decides that it is relevant to The Chronicles, but I like to please my viewers, so I willed it to happen. I don&#8217;t want people to use that search term and get disappointed when they somehow land on this site so I made it happen. Okay, I really didn&#8217;t but I did somehow manage to snap this picture accidently&#8230;<a href="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5019/5490176928_83cbf33bfe_o.jpg" target="_blank">I&#8217;m sure you guys want to see a larger version so CLICK HERE (800x1200px)</a></p>

<p>Speaking of amazing nipples, here&#8217;s Wek&#8217;Sos Adam rocking the brand new Chronicles tee&#8230;</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s Ryan picking up some cupcakes from ATS Phil&#8217;s girl Judy. She was offering the cupcakes to spectators to raise money for a good cause which is much better than what I was doing, which was watching Jared yell at people passing by in an attempt to get them to buy merchandise&#8230;</p>
<p>With an hour or two left in the show, I decided to make one more trip outside to the second building to see what I could get pictures of before we closed up shop. It didn&#8217;t last long of course, I don&#8217;t think I even made it into the other building because there were still so many people flowing in and out&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="w13" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5257/5489565383_8116364023_o.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>I did get pictures outside though. Here&#8217;s a GS on Kartier wheels&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="w14" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5099/5489565495_98765b4936_o.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>I ran into Danny Hernandez and his Laguna Seca Blue 4-door. He looked cold and angry so I decided to ask him about his engine bay&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="w15" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5136/5490161476_6d75678911_o.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure I wasn&#8217;t the only one wondering why he had this carbon kevlar sheet mounted on top of his intake manifold so I decided to ask him. I don&#8217;t exactly remember what he told me but it had something to do with him deciding to mount a carbon kevlar sheet on top of his intake manifold. All you need to know is that it is definitely not a part that is offered by Spoon Sports because the kevlar weave is too nice&#8230;*zing*&#8230;</p>

<p>Another shot of Mike&#8217;s engine bay and his painted engine bay and transmission. Like I stated in the previous posts, I&#8217;m boycotting taking pictures of the exterior of his car until he takes those Volk C-Ultra wheels off, haha&#8230;Big Mike and I actually saw him at the Hontune event this past weekend and even voiced our displeasure for those wheels in person to him. He however, didn&#8217;t seem to care and looked at us like we were crazy&#8230;</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a shot of DSR Loreto&#8217;s engine bay&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="w18" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5293/5490161914_ca9960b7bb_o.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>&#8230;as well as Downstar Bolt Boys Frank&#8217;s Lambo green engine bay. I would have liked to take some pictures of the cars themselves, but there were so many people in front of their cars that I felt like I was inside of a Japanese subway. I tried to bend down to take a better picture of Frank&#8217;s bay and I ended up with 4 asian dudes sitting on my shoulders&#8230;</p>

<p>After my futile attempt to walk into the other building, I decided to go back to my booth. I saw this STI on the way and decided to snap a pic. I love TE37SL wheels on basically anything. I&#8217;m trying to love this wheel as much as I can before Rota comes out with a Rota SL or some shit with a pink label on it that says Rota Super Laps or whatever&#8230;</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s James Balizan from Wek&#8217;Sos and 137 Wayne. Waynes been saying that he&#8217;s growing his hair out for charity for the longest time now but I&#8217;m starting to get a little sketchy about it. Not because I doubt him doing it for charity but more so because I&#8217;m not sure if anyone would want a donation of a large bag of curly brown hairs&#8230;</p>

<p>Speaking of curly brown hairs, Justene Jaro is completely absent of all of it, at least from the pictures I&#8217;ve seen online. Would you like to see a bigger picture of the one above?

<p>Here&#8217;s Ryan Der&#8217;s Civic on Work Meister S1 wheels&#8230;Not sure how I feel about them since I loved the aggressive TE37s so much, but hey, Ryan Der has like thousands of sets of wheels so he doesn&#8217;t care what I think&#8230;</p>

<p>Arn&#8217;s DC2 with Arn apparently dancing in the background&#8230;If you&#8217;re wondering why a valve cover is laying on the floor during a car show, that&#8217;s actually Big Mike&#8217;s. That doesn&#8217;t explain why of course, but scroll up to look at the Christine Mendoza picture and you won&#8217;t give a shit anymore&#8230;.</p>
<p>I was able to take a couple shots of the cars at this time because the show had begun to clear out and the awards were being announced. I didn&#8217;t get to really watch the awards because I was too busy trying to clean up so that I could get the fuck outta there. It was cold as shit by then and I really wanted to just go back to the hotel and take a shit and eat a burrito. I know a bunch of ATS guys won, Salem won, and umm&#8230;oh yeah, Big Mike won. It was cool, congrats to all of them but it was really time to get back to the hotel&#8230;If you want to see the awards ceremony and the pics with all the winners, head on over to JSJbrothers.com after you finish reading this and you can see all kinds of pictures&#8230;</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the burrito I ate. I think I really had to shit at some point during the night but I knocked out before that could happen. I was kinda waiting for people to hit me up to chill after they had finished their dinners but I was so tired that I just fell asleep watching a replay of the NBA All-Star game&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="w28" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5218/5490163022_f916eb2e81_o.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>The next morning, it was time to pack up and head home to Socal. May and I got up and went to grab some free breakfast that was offered by the hotel, and we ran into everyone else there. We sat down and ate, talked about Wekfest and how many people were there and then we went back to the room to get ready. Some of the guys were already outside taping up their cars and loading up&#8230;</p>

<p>DPK Chuy&#8217;s Integra, which you didn&#8217;t get to see a whole lot of because he didn&#8217;t make the drive up with us&#8230;</p>

<p>Big Mike, who doesn&#8217;t need blue tape because he invested in a clear bra&#8230;</p>

<p>Oh, I really didn&#8217;t get a chance to snap a photo at the event, but here&#8217;s the Honda Tuning CR-Z with all the new custom fabricated stuff from ASC Speed Metal&#8230;</p>

<p>Big Mike and May listening to a story that Rodrez was telling us about how one of the judges at Wekfest was trying to school Rodrez on Big Mike&#8217;s car, not knowing that both of them had known eachother for almost a decade now. According to this guy, Big Mike has been building his Prelude for 11 years now and he recently got rid of his Mugen eyelids. In reality, Big Mike has probably had his car for like 5-6 years, and has never once owned a pair of Mugen eyelids for a Prelude. But that&#8217;s okay, I&#8217;m sure Rodrez enjoyed the story and being educated on a car that he&#8217;s very familiar with&#8230;</p>
<p>The rest are just random shots of whatever I saw when I had my camera out on the way home to Socal. We took breaks along the way home to get gas and eat, so I just took out my camera whenever I could&#8230;</p>

<p>The &#8220;face&#8221; of DPK&#8230;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s pretty much it. We got back to Socal late Monday night and parted ways to go home. Overall, man&#8230;I couldn&#8217;t say anything but good things about Wekfest 2011. The event itself was unbelievable. The venue this year was great and the turnout could not have been any better. I saw a lot of people complaining about the wait times in line, but shit, that&#8217;s what happens when there is so much hype and excitement behind an event of this magnitude. You know how you solve that problem? You show up earlier so you don&#8217;t have to wait as long. I&#8217;m sure there are ways to improve this event and the Wek&#8217;Sos guys are already working hard on it to make it better than ever next year. They&#8217;re already planning for the Wekfest Socal event this summer as well as a nationwide tour in the future&#8230;</p>
<p>People I should really thank are&#8230;</p>
<p>The entire Wekfest staff for being so hard working and easy to deal with&#8230;</p>
<p>Ken, Adam, and Junior for putting this all together&#8230;</p>
<p>My Maybelyn for helping me hold down the fort and organizing my merchandise so that it was easy to operate the booth&#8230;</p>
<p>Tina for helping May and I set-up&#8230;</p>
<p>HeyMikeyyyy and the rest of my Phaze2 family&#8230;</p>
<p>Rodrez for offering his Element to transport all the goods and luggage up there, as well as helping me get my booth spot in the first place&#8230;</p>
<p>Tes for finding all the good food spots to eat at and always finding directions and better routes to get places&#8230;</p>
<p>DPK David, Jared, Ryan, and the rest of the DPK guys for embarking on this adventure with The Chronicles&#8230;</p>
<p>The ATS family for always being so generous and helpful&#8230;</p>
<p>Greg at Trendy Threadz for pulling through in the clutch and getting my shirts done in almost zero amount of time&#8230;</p>
<p>Big Mike for organizing his gigantic food meet and getting enthusiasts from all over the country together (even though I couldn&#8217;t make it)&#8230;</p>
<p>Christine Mendoza for wearing that shirt&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;and to everyone else who either picked up Chronicles merchandise or just stopped by to even say what&#8217;s up. I love you all for always continuing to support this little site known as The Chronicles&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="w37" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5014/5490163748_58843292b8_o.jpg" alt="" width="533" height="800" /></p>
<p>&#8230;oh and I can&#8217;t forget to congratulate Big Mike on once again, winning Best Honda at Wekfest. That&#8217;s two years in a row now. All he needs is one more and I think he&#8217;s going to be considered a dynasty&#8230;.haha. Thanks for looking everyone&#8230;that&#8217;s a wrap on Wekfest 2011 NORCAL&#8230;.</p>

<p>May has been waiting to meet Anh&#8217;s baby forever now and she finally got a chance to see baby Charis in person for the first time. She was so excited&#8230;This is a rare moment because the booth was so busy that day that May rarely had time to hold other people&#8217;s asian babies. I gotta give May the biggest thanks in the whole world for helping me run the booth while I ran around. She organized everything in such a way that it was easy for me and the other homies who were helping out to get my product out to people. One of the reasons why I love her so much is that she&#8217;s pretty crazy about organization whereas I don&#8217;t really give a shit, so it works out, haha. I&#8217;ve told her a thousand times in person but she deserves all the credit in the world for holding it down for me at the booth&#8230;</p>

<p>The Truong family&#8230;I really wish I had taken the picture one second early before Charis decided to move around&#8230;haha&#8230;oh well, it can&#8217;t be any worse than me spelling Anh&#8217;s wife, Eachan&#8217;s name wrong in his Super Street feature. Man, I fucked that up&#8230; =P</p>

<p>This is what I was talking about when I said she was holding down the booth. It got crazy at some parts during the day when people were lining up to buy stuff. It&#8217;s crazy and honestly a little surprising. I didn&#8217;t know people were so crazy about my site. Here you can also see the tent without the top, thanks to &#8220;fire code&#8221;. My booth was Dr. Phil that day. Had the shit on the side but the top was bald&#8230;I was actually going to give away a shirt to whoever was down to scale the canopy like Spiderman but no amount of insurance would allow me to let some dude fly into someone else&#8217;s car and possibly kill himself. That and the Wek&#8217;Sos guys would have been fucking pissed about it&#8230;haha&#8230;</p>

<p>If you guys saw part 3 of the coverage, you saw me talk about this little private bet I made with the girls where if I saw 3 or more people wearing a Big Mike Eefect shirt, I would go buy one&#8230;.well, I guess it&#8217;s time for me to place an order&#8230;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all for today. Just one more part to the Wekfest 2011 coverage and that wrap&#8217;s it up. Then after that it&#8217;s the Hontune event coverage from this past weekend&#8230;see you tomorrow&#8230;</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">Billy driving through in his HKS-themed IS300. I think many people are confused and think that he has the HKS livery because he&#8217;s sponsored by HKS and that&#8217;s not the case. He&#8217;s just a huge fan of HKS products and he felt that the graphical livery would look great on his IS&#8230;</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">I hope I have another photo of this Civic somewhere in my memory card so that I can show you what I&#8217;m talking about but I really like this Civic. One of the reasons is that I love the newer body Civics with the FD2 conversions and I also like this one because it has Advan Sierra Gen. II wheels on it and those are also some of my favorite wheels of all time. I think those wheels were really slept on throughout the years and they look great on this car&#8230;</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">Really liked this STI and I stared at it throughout the day because it was parked directly across from my booth. Love the subtle Chargespeed aero and the VS-XXs, while terribly over-used nowadays, flows really well on this car&#8230;</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">&#8230;I was completely mind-fucked when I saw this Rays G-Games wheel on this NSX. I think I almost tripped on the face of this wheel when I walked by it. Someone has to know more information on this wheel and it&#8217;s sizing because it is the craziest fucking thing I have ever seen. What is this, like +142 offset? Yikes&#8230;</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">The whole &#8220;Neo-chrome&#8221; look is really popular up in Norcal&#8230;It&#8217;s a cool finish and I saw it on this Integra&#8230;</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">&#8230;as well as this K-swapped EG. There&#8217;s another blue car, a BMW coupe, that has the same finish on the wheels and it&#8217;s pretty wild looking&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><img class="alignnone" title="w48" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5218/5475670402_41379a21c7_o.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Mike from Bandit&#8217;s 4-door Civic bay&#8230;I&#8217;d have taken a pic of the whole car but it was too crowded at the time and I&#8217;m also boycotting the exterior of his car until he takes those 3-spoke wheels off his car, haha. I love the build and it was absolutely stunning on the black Wedsports with the red lettering but the current wheels are killing me!&#8230;Somebody had to say it!&#8230;</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">Sunny&#8217;s Honda Insight on bags&#8230;Rodrez is in the background either yawning or saying &#8220;daaaaaaammmn&#8221;&#8230;.haha&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><img class="alignnone" title="w50" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5014/5475072113_e3ccf1176a_o.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The Chronicles booth finally all set-up. You&#8217;ll see in later pictures that the canopy we were using was without a top and it looks really weird. This wasn&#8217;t done on purpose. According to building officials, having a top on a canopy violates fire code inside Fort Mason. How a canopy top can be dangerous, I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;d be concerned more with the hundreds of cars inside the building with gas inside of them and all the electrical equipment everywhere but that&#8217;s just me. I wouldn&#8217;t be worried so much about the top being on fire because I&#8217;d be running out as all the cars exploded&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Funny story though, when Rodrez and I were in  the second building doing coverage, we saw the &#8220;Slammed Society&#8221; booth and the people setting up their huge 10&#215;20+ size tent. I mean, this tent was a big motherfucker, probably took like 8 people to set it up. We looked at each other and wondered if we should tell them that they couldn&#8217;t have a top on their canopy but then I saw this lady holding her toddler and they were having such a blast as they were pulling the corner down on one of the ends of the tent. I didn&#8217;t want to ruin their moment which would have possibly been a lifelong memory for the child so I turned to Rodrez and was like &#8220;nah, I don&#8217;t think we should tell them&#8221; knowing that in about 5 minutes, someone would come by and ask them to take it down again&#8230; =P &#8230;.Kinda messed up but hey, the kid was having such a blast and I am all about the children&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><img class="alignnone" title="w51" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5299/5475072275_131bae0217_o.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The homie Doug, who had decided not to come up to SF but then made the trip up after realizing how much of an asshole move it was to not spend time with his friends just so he could hang out with some broad&#8230;haha&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><img class="alignnone" title="w52" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5171/5475072359_845cf62440_o.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The Herbst Pavilion, or what I have been referring to as &#8220;the second building&#8221;, which was filled with mostly VIP cars and NSXs. This building was also where Bolt Boys and Sportcar Motion was placed&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Now I know you guys have heard a lot of stories about how long the lines were, I just don&#8217;t think you can possibly grasp just how large it was unless you were actually there. I was doing other stuff at the time but everyone kept telling me to go outside to see the line. I finally bit and I walked outside and was completely blown away&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><img class="alignnone" title="w53" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1396/5475670898_5336b312ca_o.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" /></p>

<p style="text-align:left;">&#8230;and this was just the front! The line actually extended outside the Fort Mason area and went down what I was told to be about 4 city blocks. People are fucking crazy&#8230;Wekfest 2011 brings out the masses for sure&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">That&#8217;s about all for today, next update will include various things from the actual show because the gates finally opened and maybe the next one after that will be the final part where we head back to Socal and what not&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Make sure to hit up Hontune this weekend at Autoclub Speedway!</p>

I didn&#8217;t want to be a burden on anyone and they were super cool about taking us everywhere&#8230;</p>
<p>Anyways, on with the coverage. After the Wek&#8217;Sos dinner, I went back to the room to try to get some sleep but I&#8217;ve just never been fond of sleeping in a bed that&#8217;s not my own. The best part of staying at the hotel we were at was that there was free breakfast every morning. Not only that, the breakfast was actually GOOD. I really wanted to sleep more because I was tossing and turning all night but May decided that sleep wasn&#8217;t important to me and she woke me up to go get breakfast&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="w1" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5136/5474574603_d6a5f9f0a2_o.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>They had these sausage breakfast sandwiches that were pretty good and I sat down and ate while I stared at my copy of Homeboys vs. Cholos. After that I got dressed and went down to the other guys&#8217; rooms to see what was going on. DPK David was out draining the water out from inside his car at ATS Ray&#8217;s house while Rodrez and them were busy leaving this in front of my door&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="w2" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5178/5475171206_17405ee2c4_o.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>I looked outside and people walking by were staring at me like I was crazy. At first I didn&#8217;t know who it was and thought it was David, who was staying across the hall from me, so I returned the favor by hanging bagels on his door. Of course, it wasn&#8217;t actually him as he wasn&#8217;t even at the hotel and his girl Jackie woke up with a bagel surprise on her doorknob&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="w3" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5015/5475171340_0805fb9c4a_o.jpg" alt="" width="533" height="800" /></p>
<p>We walked down the hall to the room where the rest of the 57 guys were staying and Jared was busy cutting Ryan&#8217;s hair. I don&#8217;t know if Jared had ever used clippers before or even known of their existence since he gets all his fancy haircuts in Hollywood where they use diamond-layered scissors but he made a good attempt at cleaning Ryan up. Another questionable thing about the whole haircut was that Ryan had a towel draped over his shoulder that had what looked to be chilli all over it, or some sort of cheese, or burrito sauce. I wonder what the cleaning lady was thinking when she picked up a towel off the floor with redish brown shit all over it and gobs of loose hair&#8230;</p>
<p>Shit was shot for a minute but then we set off to go to the store to pick-up some items that we needed for the rest of the weekend. Once we got out of the Burlingame area, it was off to the city to go grab lunch. The girls found this one place that they wanted to try out called &#8220;Cha Cha Cha&#8221; on Haight Street. David was still busy working on his car with the other guys at Ray&#8217;s so just the girls met up with us to eat&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="w4" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5254/5474574853_0d7a973cb4_o.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>Cha Cha Cha was this little hole-in-the-wall Tapas plates that serves up small plates of food. I try to calamari wherever I got and this place was pretty good. May ordered up some Sangria while we waited for her Seafood Paella to show up&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="w5" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5212/5475171480_df2aa9487b_o.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>The decor of the place is pretty interesting if you like sitting inside places that make you feel like you&#8217;re sitting outside&#8230;.They had makeshift plants everywhere and all the waiters there looked like they should be taking your order while sitting on a giant Spanish horse but yeah, uhhh, it was cool&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="w6" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5300/5475171528_d6f73129d3_o.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>Seafood Paella was pretty good with the exception of the olives which I do not like to eat at all&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="w7" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5018/5474575001_83ab80be24_o.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>We cruised the city after that and hit up the usual spots that we like to visit when we&#8217;re up in SF&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="w8" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5097/5474575103_e8fe402535_o.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>We passed through the Castro Street area, which is an area that&#8217;s more devoted to the gay community and they had some interesting names for restaurants that reflected that&#8230;</p>
<p>There was some interesting sites on those streets. I&#8217;m a firm believer in being whoever you want to be and whether you&#8217;re gay or straight is cool with me but we saw the craziest thing when we drove through that area. Mind you, it was still raining pretty hard at the time so everyone was all dressed for cold weather. We saw this one dude however, who was wearing like pink underwear on the street, with a tanktop on, bright red Nikes, and a gold crown. It wasn&#8217;t even like, a fake Burger King crown, it was a full on gold crown, and this dude was rocking it on the street in the pouring rain&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="w9" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5217/5474723137_0492afcf09_o.jpg" alt="" width="533" height="800" /></p>
<p>Here is an artist&#8217;s depiction of what we saw&#8230;Craziest shit we had seen all weekend, I swear. Whatever floats your boat dude, rock on, haha&#8230;</p>
<p>We went back to the hotel after that to get some rest before dinner later that night. Big Mike had his whole giant food meet going on at Steelhead Brewery, which ended up with over 60 people showing up, but Rodrez, Tes, May, and I didn&#8217;t get a chance to stop by. We had to organize all the booth stuff and load it up into the car and dinner ran a bit late so it just wasn&#8217;t a good idea to go there. It would have been cool but we had to wake up around 5:30-6am to drive to Fort Mason for roll-in&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="w10" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5174/5475171772_441433c161_o.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>The rain was still coming down but by the evening, it eventually let up and stopped. Rain was a huge factor all weekend as the cars had to be cleaned for the show early Sunday. Luckily it stopped just in time for us to have a chance to clean up&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="w11" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5011/5475338700_d62b419abc_o.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="478" /></p>
<p>It was around 11:30 or so by the time we went to a local coin-op car wash. The girls volunteered to load up the Element with some of the lighter stuff while Rodrez and I cruised out in the CR-Z for a wash&#8230;</p>
<p>We called it a night after the wash and woke up early next morning to head out to Fort Mason. We were familiar with the location of Fort Mason because we actually stopped by after dinner to see exactly where it was at. There was no real traffic at that hour in the morning anyway so the drive was pretty simple&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="w12" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5058/5474575853_a44c30c209_o.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>The location itself was pretty amazing. Compared to a parking structure in J-town in year&#8217;s past, this location was a prime spot for the Wekfest event. I knew that it was going to be in two large buildings but I had no idea it was separated from the main street&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="w13" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5016/5475171846_25a4400a9d_o.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>The scenery was absolutely breath-taking&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="w14" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5259/5475172208_748dda0acc_o.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>The Golden Gate Bridge could even be seen in the distance&#8230;I originally thought that this spot was closer to Fisherman&#8217;s Wharf but it was actually in a totally different area&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="w15" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5139/5475172652_884aa6f110_o.jpg" alt="" width="533" height="800" /></p>
<p>The craziest thing was that it was completely dry that day and the sun was actually out really early. Just shows how much pull the Wek&#8217;Sos guys have, haha, they can even change the weather. The previous days were filled with storms and heavy rain but on the Sunday of Wekfest, you couldn&#8217;t have ever thought that it rained at all the days before&#8230;.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="w16" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5176/5474575433_8028df8e4f_o.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>Waiting in line for vendor roll-in&#8230;</p>

<p>Check-in for the show, which we apparently didn&#8217;t have to do since we were vendors so we stood in line for nothing&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="w18" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5214/5474575495_feaf99eccc_o.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" /></p>

<p>We stood in line for a bit while the staff inside was still preparing the area for us to come in. I just hung out and took random shots of whatever was around, including this Work Equip wheel&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="w20" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5018/5474575301_8f1652740a_o.jpg" alt="" width="533" height="800" /></p>

<p>It took some time but we finally made our way inside the venue. I drove the Element inside the building that we were in, unloaded all of our gear, and then drove it back to the little lot in front to park the car for the rest of the day. Then I grabbed my camera and continued to shoot whatever I saw until I got back inside the building to se-up the booth&#8230;</p>

<p>I think this drag car was from the Bay Area&#8230;.I&#8217;m not 100% sure but I had a feeling&#8230;</p>

<p>I had the pleasure of writing Wek&#8217;Sos Ken&#8217;s gold EP3 Civic feature in Honda Tuning a couple years back. In fact, it was the first feature I had ever written for any publication. Ken thought the story was the worst thing on Earth so he quickly got rid of the car and bought this E60 BMW. Must.Be.Nice&#8230;</p>

<p>The calm before the storm&#8230;I figured I&#8217;d take a picture of the Wekfest decor before random ass kids attempted to steal the flags and then take them home and not do anything with them&#8230;Believe it or not, that&#8217;s what some people like to do. I even had a guy come up to my booth after the show and asked if I could give him my banners. What the fuck? Are banners cheap these days?&#8230;</p>

<p>I also wrote a story for Honda Tuning on this DA a couple years ago. This Integra is unique because it&#8217;s remained unchanged for almost a decade now. Still has old school Racing Hart C5 wheels, Wings West kit, and even an original DRAG turbo kit&#8230;pretty cool stuff&#8230;</p>

<p>Somebody said &#8220;hey fuck you guys&#8221;, and decided to bring out his 1974 Pantera. Yeah&#8230;.</p>

<p>This is my last memory of the Fort Mason Festival Pavillion before it was filled up with rows and rows of cars and over 20,000 people&#8230;</p>

<p>You guys probably remember me talking about this WRC wagon a couple weeks ago. I did a story on it for Super Street and it was cool to actually meet and speak to the owner in person. I rarely get the opportunity and the owner, Joseph, is a really pleasant dude to speak to&#8230;</p>

I&#8217;ve actually been trying to catch up on some sleep as well because sleeping however many nights in a hotel just ain&#8217;t regular sleep. I kept waking up randomly in the middle of the night and wondering what time it was. Before I officially begin the coverage, I just want to give thanks to everyone that took time to stop by the booth to say what&#8217;s up, even if they didn&#8217;t purchase anything. The Chronicles booth at Wekfest was a huge success and I have to also thank Ernesto, Ken, and Adam at Wek&#8217;Sos for giving me such a great spot. I was right up by the entrance and it was basically the second booth that anyone saw right when they walked in. That gave my booth an amazing amount of foot traffic and many people were able to pick up the new Chronicles merchandise. Man, what a great weekend it was. Everything went very smoothly and minus the drive up, which was a little bit of a test for the other guys rolling with me, things couldn&#8217;t have gone better. The coverage doesn&#8217;t consist of just cars as many of you who follow the site should expect by now. I cover the entire weekend, from the drive up, to the show, all the way to the drive home. I want to give you guys a good idea of how things came together for the event and what we did outside of the show. It&#8217;s more than just the cars and the show itself, it&#8217;s all about the people and the experiences that we shared. With that said, let&#8217;s begin&#8230;If you have a somewhat slow connection or have a smart phone, there&#8217;s a chance this will go very slowly because of the multitude of pictures. You&#8217;ve been warned, haha&#8230;</p>
<p>The morning started out for us Friday morning at about 5am. Of course I was late because I was busy trying to load up the car but we all met up at DPK David&#8217;s house to begin our caravan to Norcal&#8230;</p>

<p>We all stopped by to fill up so that we all had gas on the drive up. There was a chance we would hit a little bit of traffic in Downtown Los Angeles so we didn&#8217;t want to have to stop&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="w2" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5054/5471693179_2a3f8efe2c_o.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>Once we got past the Calabasas area, we finally made a stop so that people could grab some coffee and use the restrooms. I ended up not bringing my Q45 up for the trip because there was a huge storm midway through the drive that we were anticipating and I felt like it was too risky for me to take my car up. I haven&#8217;t driven it too much lately so being engulfed in a storm in a car that I hadn&#8217;t been reacquainted with was dangerous. On top of that, I had so much luggage and merchandise to carry along with Rodrez&#8217;s NWP merchandise that we would have had to bring an extra car anyway. Since he was bringing the Honda Tuning CR-Z up, we would need another car to get around. Being that I wasn&#8217;t driving my car up, we decided that I would just drive his Honda Element up instead&#8230;</p>

<p>A little bit of standing around and shooting the shit before our drive resumed&#8230;</p>

<p>We would randomly switch positions just to keep it interesting, here&#8217;s a shot that May took with Sheepey and Rodrez in the back&#8230;</p>

<p>Of course I couldn&#8217;t tell who was in the back because I had so much shit in the Element that I couldn&#8217;t even see out of the back. It was almost like driving a U-Haul truck&#8230;</p>

<p>The storm was on and off at that point but we took the 101 straight up to Norcal and hit random patches where the rain was a bit lighter. Here we are driving under a rainbow&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="w18" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5218/5471694415_e7dd18f8ca_o.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>It didn&#8217;t last long though as the heavy rain came pouring down immediately after. Some of the guys no longer had defrost or heat since they were removed and had trouble seeing as it was getting just as wet inside the car as the outside&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="w19" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5177/5472287334_039697650a_o.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>Eventually we had to make a stop for some food so we stopped at this random ass town where people were staring at the cars like they were spaceships from the future or something&#8230;</p>

<p>After eating at a local El Pollo Loco, we stopped off at the gas station once again so that the guys could get some water out of their cars and to secure random things that had moved around during the drive&#8230;</p>

<p>May didn&#8217;t take too many more pictures after that but we did capture this photo of Big Mike using a car-lighter powered blow dryer to defrost his windows&#8230;haha&#8230;</p>
<p>37 hours later, we finally made it to Northern California. We got settled down at our hotel and unloaded our luggage and got some rest. Later that night we were invited to a private Wek&#8217;Sos/Wekfest pre-party at a Japanese restaurant called Kaenyama. The Wek&#8217;Sos guys always take care of us and it was a pleasure to have dinner with them&#8230;</p>

<p>We stopped by Jared/Ryan/Alex/Gandolf/Fedor Emelianako&#8217;s room to hang out for a little bit. Here&#8217;s a group shot of the Seinfeld coalition minus Ryan Der&#8230;</p>

<p>It was a bit of a drive but we had been on the road for 42 days for our drive from Socal to San Francisco so the drive to the restaurant wasn&#8217;t bad at all. Plus there was free food and drinks and we weren&#8217;t about to turn that down. When we got there Jared and the rest of the homies were already eating in one of the rooms. It was one of those traditional Japanese spots where you have to take your shoes off and what not&#8230;</p>

<p>ATS Ferd and Phil&#8230;</p>
<p>Overall, it was a cool dinner. Nothing I expected being that we hadn&#8217;t really had anything planned that night. Turned out to be a great time hanging out with great people. And again, free food and drinks, come on&#8230;haha. Many many many thanks to Wek&#8217;Sos and all the guys from ATS Garage for always showing us hospitality&#8230; It was a pleasure to be in your company&#8230;</p>
<p>So after that, it was time to head back to the room to get some rest. On the way back, Rodrez, Tes, May, and I stopped by at a random ass supermarket called &#8220;Food Maxx&#8221; to get some fruits and water and shit for the room. It&#8217;s like one of those generic markets where everything is &#8220;Rota&#8217;d&#8221; out&#8230;They had this section that Rodrez and I spotted that had like, the worst movies ever made. It was just some shit that you had to be there to experience. Some of the movies were so bad, that I just had to buy them because people wouldn&#8217;t believe me if I had just simply mentioned it to them. I picked up two of movies that had the best titles&#8230;.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="w53" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5133/5472290224_511aacfd2e_o.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>I picked up &#8220;Random Victims of L.A.&#8221; and a 4-movie compilation called &#8220;Homebodys vs. Cholos&#8221;. Yes, you read that right&#8230;.Homeboys&#8230;versus&#8230;Cholos. We immediately opened it up in the car and tried to watch it in the Element&#8217;s DVD player but the discs were so scratched up that it wouldn&#8217;t even play. I mean, the DVD&#8217;s didn&#8217;t even have labels so we couldn&#8217;t even tell which side was the right side. That and they were sealed and came out fucking scratched to all hell when I tore the packaging apart. It was ridiculous! Haha, eventually we got back to the hotel and tried to play it on a laptop with VLC player and it finally played. It was, umm&#8230;interesting, to say the least. The first fight scene lasted like 40 minutes where they were fighting with chains hand-to-hand and kitchen knives. It was fucking awful&#8230;According to the DVD though, Homeboys vs. Cholos won &#8220;Best Foreing&#8221; film of 2006. Yes, FOREING FILM. What a great way to end the night&#8230;</p>
<p>Alright, we&#8217;re gonna stop here for today and continue tomorrow with more stuff. Thanks for looking&#8230;</p>

I&#8217;m just trying to go through all this stuff right now and trying to get a little bit of rest at the same time since we just got back late last night.
